PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION
</p>

<p>For a good many years past I have been allowed to
comment, in letters to <i>The Times</i>, upon points of
International Law, as they have been raised by the events
of the day. These letters have been fortunate enough to
attract some attention, both at home and abroad, and
requests have frequently reached me that they should be
rendered more easily accessible than they can be in the
files of the newspaper in which they originally appeared.</p>

<p>I have, accordingly, thought that it might be worth
while to select, from a greater number, such of my letters
as bear upon those questions of War and Neutrality of
which so much has been heard in recent years, and to
group them for republication, with some elucidatory matter
(more especially with reference to changes introduced by
the Geneva Convention of 1906, The Hague Conventions
of 1907, and the Declaration of London of the present
year) under the topics to which they respectively relate.</p>

<p>The present volume has been put together in accordance
with this plan; and my best thanks are due to the
proprietors of The Times for permitting the reissue of
the letters in a collected form. Cross-references and a full
Index will, I hope, to some extent remove the difficulties
which might otherwise be caused by the fragmentary
character, and the chances of repetition, inseparable from
such a work.</p>

<p class="sectionhead">PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION</p>

<p>I have again to thank <i>The Times</i> for permission to print in
this new edition letters which have appeared in its columns
during the past four years. They will be found to deal largely
with still unsettled questions suggested by the work of
the Second Peace Conference, by the Declaration of London,
and by the, unfortunately conceived, Naval Prize Bill of
1911.</p>

<p>I have no reason to complain of the reception which
has so far been accorded to the views which I have thought
it my duty to put forward.</p>

<p class="sectionhead">PREFACE TO THE THIRD EDITION</p>

<p>This, doubtless final, edition of my letters upon War and
Neutrality contains, by renewed kind permission of <i>The
Times</i>, the whole series of such letters, covering a period
of no less than forty years. To the letters which have
already appeared in former editions, I have now added
those contained in the &quot;Supplement&quot; of 1916 (for some
time out of print) to my second edition; as also others of
still more recent date. All these have been grouped, as
were their predecessors, under the various topics which
they were intended to illustrate. The explanatory commentaries
have been carefully brought up to date, and
a perhaps superfluously full Index should facilitate reference
for those interested in matters of the kind. Such
persons may not be sorry to have their attention recalled
to many questions which have demanded practical treatment
of late years, more especially during the years of
the great war.</p>

<p>Not a few of these questions are sure again to come
to the front, so soon as the rehabilitation of International
Law, rendered necessary by the conduct of that War,
shall be seriously taken in hand.</p>

OF INTERNATIONAL CONTROVERSIES</p>


<h3 class="sectionhead"><a name="CHAPTER_I_SECTION_1" />SECTION 1</h3>

<p class="subsectionhead">Friendly Measures</p>

<div class="intronotes"><p>Of the letters which follow, the first was suggested by a petition
presented in October, 1899, to the President of the United States,
asking him to use his good offices to terminate the war in South Africa;
the second by discussions as to the advisability of employing, for the
first time, an International Commission of Enquiry, for the purpose
of ascertaining the facts of the lamentable attack perpetrated by the
Russian fleet upon British fishing vessels off the Dogger Bank, on
October 21, 1905. The Commission sat from January 19 to February
25, 1905, and its report was the means of terminating a period of
great tension in the relations of the two Powers concerned (see <i>Parl.
Paper</i>, Russia, 1905, No. 3): this letter deals also with Arbitration,
under The Hague Convention of 1899.</p>

<p>It may be worth while here to point out that besides direct negotiation
between the Powers concerned, four friendly methods for the
settlement of questions at issue between them are now recognised,
<i>viz</i> (1) Good offices and mediation of third Powers; (2) &quot;Special
mediation&quot;; (3) &quot;International Commissions of Enquiry&quot;; (4)
Arbitration. All four were recommended by The Hague Convention
of 1899 &quot;For the Peaceful Settlement of International Disputes&quot;
(by which, indeed, (2) and (3) were first suggested), as also by the
amended re-issue of that convention in 1907. It must be noticed
that resort to any of these methods is entirely discretionary, so far
as any rule of International Law is concerned; all efforts to render
it universally and unconditionally obligatory having, perhaps fortunately,
hitherto failed.</p>

<p>It remains to be seen how far the settlement of international
controversies has been facilitated by the establishment of a &quot;League
<span class="newpage"><a name="page002" id="page002">[002]</a></span>of Nations&quot; (to which reference is made in the concluding letters of
this chapter), and, in particular, by the plan for the establishment of
a &quot;Permanent Court of International Justice,&quot; formulated by the
League, in pursuance of Art. 14 of the Treaty of Versailles, and
submitted to its members in December, 1920.</p></div>

<p class="lettertitle"><a name="THE-PETITION-TO-THE-PRESIDENT-OF-THE-UNITED-STATES" />THE PETITION TO THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES</p>

<p>Sir,&mdash;It seems that a respectably, though perhaps
thoughtlessly signed petition was on Thursday presented
to President McKinley, urging him to offer his good offices
to bring to an end the war now being waged in South
Africa. From the <i>New York World</i> cablegram, it would
appear that the President was requested to take this step
&quot;in accordance with Art. 3 of the protocol of the Peace
Conference at The Hague.&quot; The reference intended is
doubtless to the <i>Convention pour le r&egrave;glement pacifique des
conflits internationaux</i>, prepared at the Conference [of 1899],
Art. 3 of which is to the following effect:&mdash;</p>

<div class="letterquot"><p>&quot;Les Puissances signataires jugent utile qu'une ou plusieurs Puissances
&eacute;trang&egrave;res au conflit offrent de leur propre initiative, en tant
que les circonstances s'y pr&ecirc;tent, leurs bons offices ou leur m&eacute;diation
aux &Eacute;tats en conflit.</p>

<p>&quot;Le droit d'offrir les bons offices ou la m&eacute;diation appartient aux
Puissances &eacute;trang&egrave;res au conflit, m&ecirc;me pendant le cours des hostilit&eacute;s.</p>

<p>&quot;L'exercice de ce droit ne peut jamais &ecirc;tre consid&eacute;r&eacute; par l'une ou
l'autre des parties en litige comme un acte peu amical.&quot;</p></div>

<p>Several remarks are suggested by the presentation of
this petition:&mdash;</p>

<p>(1) One might suppose from the glib reference here
and elsewhere made to The Hague Convention, that this
convention is already in force, whereas it is [1899], in the
case of most, if not all, of the Powers represented at the
conference, a mere unratified draft, under the consideration
of the respective Governments.</p>

<p>(2) The article, if it were in force, would impose no
duty of offering good offices, but amounts merely to the
expression of opinion that an offer of good offices is a
<span class="newpage"><a name="page003" id="page003">[003]</a></span>useful and unobjectionable proceeding, in suitable cases
(<i>en tant que les circonstances s'y pr&ecirc;tent</i>). It cannot for
a moment be supposed that the President would consider
that an opportunity of the kind contemplated was offered
by the war in South Africa.</p>

<p>(3) One would like to know at what date, if at all,
the Prime Minister of the British colony of the Cape was
pleased, as is alleged, to follow the lead of the Presidents of
the two Boer Republics in bestowing his grateful approval
upon the petition in question.</p>

<div class="postnotes"><p><i>Par.</i> 2 (1).&mdash;The Convention of 1899 was ratified by Great Britain,
on September 4, 1900; and between that year and 1907 practically
all civilised Powers ratified or acceded to it. It is now, for almost all
Powers, superseded by The Hague Convention, No. i. of 1907, which,
reproduces Art. 3 of the older Convention, inserting, however, after
the word &quot;utile,&quot; the words &quot;et d&eacute;sirable.&quot;</p>

<p><i>Ib.</i> (2).&mdash;On March 6, 1900, the two Boer Republics proposed that
peace should be made on terms which included the recognition of
their independence. Great Britain having, on March 11, declared
such recognition to be inadmissible, the European Powers which were
requested to use their good offices to bring this about declined so to
intervene. The President of the United States, however, in a note
delivered in London on March 13, went so far as to &quot;express an earnest
hope that a way to bring about peace might be found,&quot; and to say that
he would aid &quot;in any friendly manner to bring about so happy a
result.&quot; Lord Salisbury, on the following day, while thanking the
United States Government, replied that &quot;H.M. Government does
not propose to accept the intervention of any Power in the South
African War.&quot; Similar replies to similar offers had been made both
by France and Prussia in 1870, and by the United States in 1898.</p></div>


<p class="lettertitle"><a name="COMMISSIONS-OF-ENQUIRY-AND-THE-HAGUE-CONVENTION" />COMMISSIONS OF ENQUIRY AND THE HAGUE
CONVENTION</p>

<p>Sir,&mdash;It is just now [1904] especially desirable that the
purport of those provisions of The Hague Convention &quot;for
the peaceful settlement of international controversies&quot;<span class="newpage"><a name="page004" id="page004">[004]</a></span>
which deal with &quot;international commissions of enquiry&quot;
should be clearly understood. It is probably also desirable
that a more correct idea should be formed of the effect
of that convention, as a whole, than seems to be generally
prevalent. You may, therefore, perhaps, allow me to say
a few words upon each of these topics.</p>

<p>Art. 9 of the convention contains an expression of
opinion to the effect that recourse to an international
commission of enquiry into disputed questions of fact
would be useful. This recommendation is, however,
restricted to &quot;controversies in which neither honour nor
essential interests are involved,&quot; and is further limited by
the phrase &quot;so far as circumstances permit.&quot; Two points
are here deserving of notice.</p>

<p>In the first place, neither &quot;the honour and vital interests
clause,&quot; as seems to be supposed by your correspondent
Mr. Schidrowitz, nor the clause as to circumstances permitting,
is in any way modified by the article which
follows. Art. 10 does not enlarge the scope of Art. 9,
but merely indicates the procedure to be followed by
Powers desirous of acting under it. In the second place,
it is wholly unimportant whether or no the scope of
Art. 9 is enlarged by Art. 10. The entire liberty of
the Powers to make any arrangement which may seem
good to them for clearing up their differences is neither
given, nor impaired, by the articles in question, to which
the good sense of the Conference declined to attach any
such obligatory force as had been proposed by Russia. It
may well be that disputant Powers may at any time
choose to agree to employ the machinery suggested by
those articles, or something resembling it, in cases of a
far more serious kind than those to which alone the convention
ventured to make its recommendation applicable;
and this is the course which seems to have been followed
by the Powers interested with reference to the recent
lamentable occurrence in the North Sea.<span class="newpage"><a name="page005" id="page005">[005]</a></span></p>

<p>As to the convention as a whole, it is important to
bear in mind that, differing in this respect from the two
other conventions concluded at The Hague, it is of a
non-obligatory character, except in so far as it provides
for the establishment of a permanent tribunal at The
Hague, to which, however, no Power is bound to resort.
It resembles not so much a treaty as a collection of &quot;pious
wishes&quot; (<i>voeux</i>), such as those which were also adopted
at The Hague. The operative phrases of most usual occurrence
in the convention are, accordingly, such as &quot;jugent
utile&quot;; &quot;sont d'accord pour recommander&quot;; &quot;est reconnu
comme le moyen le plus efficace&quot;; &quot;se r&eacute;servent de conclure
des accords nouveaux, en vue d'&eacute;tendre l'arbitrage
obligatoire &agrave; tous les cas qu'elles jugeront possible de lui
soumettre.&quot;</p>

<p>It is a matter for rejoicing that, in accordance with
the suggestion contained in the phrase last quoted, so
many treaties, of which that between Great Britain and
Portugal is the most recent, have been entered into for
referring to The Hague tribunal &quot;differences of a juridical
nature, or such as relate to the interpretation of treaties;
on condition that they do not involve either the vital
interests or the independence or honour of the two contracting
States.&quot; Such treaties, conforming as they all do
to one carefully defined type, may be productive of much
good. They testify to, and may promote, a very widely
spread <i>entente cordiale</i>, they enhance the prestige of the
tribunal of The Hague, and they assure the reference to
that tribunal of certain classes of questions which might
otherwise give rise to international complications. Beyond
this it would surely be unwise to proceed. It is beginning
to be realised that what are called &quot;general&quot; treaties of
arbitration, by which States would bind themselves beforehand
to submit to external decision questions which might
involve high political issues, will not be made between
Powers of the first importance; also, that such treaties, if
<span class="newpage"><a name="page006" id="page006">[006]</a></span>made, would be more likely to lead to fresh misunderstandings
than to secure the peaceful settlement of disputed
questions.</p>

<p><i>Par.</i> 4.&mdash;The amended Convention, as a whole, is still, like its
predecessor, purely facultative. The Russian proposal to make resort
to arbitration universally obligatory in a list of specified cases, unless
when the &quot;vital interests or national honour&quot; of States might be
involved, though negatived in 1899, was renewed in 1907, in different
forms, by several Powers, which eventually concurred in supporting
the Anglo-Portuguese-American proposal, according to which, differences
of a juridical character, and especially those relating to the
interpretation of treaties, are to be submitted to arbitration, unless
they affect the vital interests, independence, or honour, of the States
concerned, or the interests of third States; while all differences as to
the interpretation of treaties relating to a scheduled list of topics,
or as to the amount of damages payable, where liability to some
extent is undisputed, are to be so submitted without any such reservation.
This proposal was accepted by thirty-two Powers, but as
nine Powers opposed it, and three abstained from voting, it failed
to become a convention. The delegates to the Conference of 1907
went, however, so far as to include in their &quot;Final Act&quot; a statement
to the effect that they were unanimous: (1) &quot;in recognising the
principle of obligatory arbitration&quot;; (2) &quot;in declaring that certain
differences, and, in particular, such as relate to the interpretation
and application of the provisions of International Conventions, are
suitable for being submitted to obligatory arbitration, without any
reservations.&quot;</p>

<p><i>Par.</i> 5.&mdash;The Convention between France and Great Britain,
concluded on October 14, 1903, for five years, and renewed in 1908,
and again in 1913, for a like period, by which the parties agree to
submit to The Hague tribunal any differences which may arise between
them, on condition &quot;that they do not involve either the vital interests,
or the independence, or honour of the two contracting States, and that
they do not affect the interests of a third Power,&quot; has served as a model
or &quot;common form,&quot; for a very large number of conventions to the same
<span class="newpage"><a name="page007" id="page007">[007]</a></span>effect, entered into between one State and another. The Convention
of April 11, 1908, between Great Britain and the United States is
substantially of this type.</p>

<p>But see now the three letters which follow.</p></div>


<p class="lettertitle"><a name="THE-LEAGUE-OF-NATIONS-1919" />THE LEAGUE OF NATIONS</p>

<p>Sir,&mdash;The League is unquestionably &quot;a brave design.&quot;
Sympathy with its objects and some hope that they may
be realised have induced myself, as, doubtless many others,
to abstain from criticising the way in which the topic has
been handled by the representatives of the victorious
Powers. Recent discussions seem, however, to render such
reticence no longer desirable.</p>

<p>It begins to be recognised that, as some of us have all
along held to be the case, a serious mistake was made by
the Paris delegates when they combined in one and the
same document provisions needed for putting an end to
an existing state of war with other provisions aiming at
the creation in the future of a new supernational society.
Two matters so wholly incongruous in character should
surely have been dealt with separately. Whether it is
now too late to attempt a remedy for the consequences
of this unfortunate combination is a question which can
be answered only by the diplomatists whose business it is
to be intimately in touch with the susceptibilities of the
various nations concerned. In the meantime, however, on
the assumption that this state of things is productive of
regrettable results, I may perhaps venture to indicate,
recommending their adoption, the steps which appear to
be required for the reformation of the Treaty as drafted.
My suggestions would run as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>(1) Subtract from the Treaty of Versailles, Parts I. and
XIII., the former constituting a League of Nations, the
latter, in pursuance of a recital that universal peace &quot;can
be established only if it is based upon social justice,&quot; wholly
occupied with a sufficiently ambitious scheme for the
<span class="newpage"><a name="page008" id="page008">[008]</a></span>regulation by the League of all questions relating to
&quot;Labour&quot; which may arise within its jurisdiction.</p>

<p>(2) Let Part I., with Part XIII. annexed, constitute a
new and independent Treaty; to be, as such, submitted
to the Powers for further consideration. (The opportunity
might be taken of ridding it of all references to a system
of &quot;mandates,&quot; which might very probably lead to jealousies
and misunderstandings.)</p>

<p>(3) Parts II. to XII., XIV., and XV. would then constitute
the real Treaty of Peace, in which it would, however,
be necessary in the numerous articles attributing functions,
for the most part of a temporary character, the &quot;League
of Nations,&quot; to substitute for any mention of the League
words descriptive of some other authority, yet to be created,
such as, for instance, &quot;a Commission to be constituted by
the principal Allied and Associated Powers.&quot;</p>

<p class="lettertitle"><a name="THE-LEAGUE-OF-NATIONS-1919-B" /></p>

<p>Sir,&mdash;Let me assure Lord Robert Cecil that I am perfectly
serious in giving expression to a long-felt wish that
the Treaty of Peace could be relieved of articles relating
exclusively to an as yet to be created League of Nations,
and in proceeding to indicate the steps that must be taken
if this reform is to be effected.</p>

<p>It can hardly be necessary also to assure Lord Robert
that I am fully aware of the formidable, though perhaps
not insuperable, difficulties which would beset any efforts
to carry out my suggestions. He may have inferred so
much from my letter of the 16th, in which, treating the
question whether it is now too late to attempt a remedy
for the existing state of things as beyond the competence
of an outsider, I describe it as one which can be answered
&quot;only by the diplomatists whose business it is to be intimately
in touch with the susceptibilities of the various
nations concerned.&quot;<span class="newpage"><a name="page009" id="page009">[009]</a></span></p>

<p>On a point of detail, I am surprised that Lord Robert
is unwilling that the contents of Part XIII. should be
removed to their natural context, on the ground that the
Labour organisation might be annoyed if this were done.
I am, however, confident that the organisation is too intelligent
not to see that it would lose nothing if the articles
in which it is interested were made an integral part of a
Convention constituting a League of Nations; the League
being already solely charged with giving effect to the
articles in question.</p>

<p class="subsectionhead">Pacific Reprisals</p>

<div class="intronotes">
<p>The four letters next following were suggested by the ambiguous
character of the blockades instituted by France against Siam in 1893,
by the Great Powers against Crete in 1897, and by Great Britain,
Germany, and Italy, against Venezuela in 1902. The object, in each
case, was to explain the true nature of the species of reprisals known
as &quot;Pacific Blockade,&quot; and to point out the difference between the
consequences of such a measure and those which result from a &quot;Belligerent
Blockade.&quot; A fifth letter, written with reference to the action
of the Netherlands against Venezuela in 1908, emphasises the desira<span class="newpage"><a name="page010" id="page010">[010]</a></span>bility
of more clearly distinguishing between war and reprisals. On
the various applications of a blockade in time of peace, see the author's
<i>Studies in International Law</i>, pp. 130-150.</p>
</div>


<p class="lettertitle"><a name="THE-BLOCKADE-OF-THE-MENAM" />THE BLOCKADE OF THE MENAM</p>



<p>Sir,&mdash;Upon many questions of fact and of policy involved
in the quarrel between France and Siam it may be premature
as yet to expect explicit information from the French
Government; but there should not be a moment's doubt
as to the meaning of the blockade which has probably by
this time been established.</p>

<p>Is France at war with Siam? This may well be the
case, according to modern practice, without any formal
declaration of war; and it is, for international purposes,
immaterial whether the French Cabinet, if it has commenced
a war without the sanction of the Chambers, has or has not
thereby violated the French Constitution. If there is a
war, and if the blockade, being effective, has been duly
notified to the neutral Powers, the vessels of those Powers
are, of course, liable to be visited, and, if found to be engaged
in breach of the blockade, to be dealt with by the French
Prize Courts.</p>

<p>Or is France still at peace with Siam, and merely putting
upon her that form of pressure which is known as &quot;pacific
blockade&quot;?</p>

<p>In this case, since there is no belligerency there is no
neutrality, and the ships of States other than that to which
the pressure is being applied are not liable to be interfered
with. The particular mode of applying pressure without
going to war known as &quot;pacific blockade&quot; dates, as is well
known, only from 1827. It has indeed been enforced, by
England as well as by France, upon several occasions, against
the vessels of third Powers; but this practice has always
been protested against, especially by French jurists, as
an unwarrantable interference with the rights of such
Powers, and was acknowledged by Lord Palmerston to
<span class="newpage"><a name="page011" id="page011">[011]</a></span>be illegal. The British Government distinctly warned
the French in 1884 that their blockade of Formosa could
be recognised as affecting British vessels only if it constituted
an act of war against China; and when the Great
Powers in 1886 proclaimed a pacific blockade of the coasts
of Greece they carefully limited its operation to ships under
the Greek flag.</p>

<p>The Subject has been exhaustively considered by the
Institut de Droit International, which, at its meeting at
Heidelberg in 1887, arrived at certain conclusions which
may be taken to express the view of learned Europe. They
are as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="letterquot"><p>&quot;L'&eacute;tablissement d'un blocus en dehors de l'&eacute;tat de guerre ne doit
&ecirc;tre considere comme permis par le droit des gens que sous les conditions
suivantes:&mdash;</p>

<p>&quot;1. Les navires de pavillon &eacute;tranger peuvent entrer librement
malgr&eacute; le blocus.</p>

<p>&quot;2. Le blocus pacifique doit &ecirc;tre d&eacute;clar&eacute; et notifi&eacute; officiellement,
et maintenu par une force suffisante.</p>

<p>&quot;Les navires de la puissance bloqu&eacute;e qui ne respectent pas un pareil
blocus peuvent &ecirc;tre s&eacute;questr&eacute;s. Le blocus ayant cess&eacute;, ils doivent
&ecirc;tre restitu&eacute;s avec leur cargaisons &agrave; leurs propri&eacute;taires, mais sans
d&eacute;dommagement &agrave; aucun titre.&quot;</p></div>

<p>If the French wish to reap the full advantages of a
blockade of the Siamese coast they must be prepared,
by becoming belligerent, to face the disadvantages which
may result from the performance by this country of her
duties as a neutral.</p>

<p class="lettertitle"><a name="PACIFIC-BLOCKADE" />PACIFIC BLOCKADE</p>

<p>Sir,&mdash;The letter signed &quot;M.&quot; in your issue of this
morning contains, I think, some statements which ought not
to pass uncorrected. A &quot;blockade&quot; is, of course, the denial
by a naval squadron of access for vessels to a defined portion
<span class="newpage"><a name="page012" id="page012">[012]</a></span>of the coasts of a given nation. A &quot;pacific blockade&quot; is one
of the various methods&mdash;generically described as &quot;reprisals,&quot;
such as &quot;embargo,&quot; or seizure of ships on the high seas&mdash;by
which, without resort to war, pressure, topographically
or otherwise limited in extent, may be put upon an offending
State. The need for pressure of any kind is, of course,
regrettable, the only question being whether such limited
pressure be not more humane to the nation which experiences it,
and less distasteful to the nation which exercises it,
than is the letting loose of the limitless calamities of war.</p>

<p>The opinion of statesmen and jurists upon this point
has undergone a change, and this because the practice
known as &quot;pacific blockade&quot; has itself changed. The
practice, which is comparatively modern, dating only from
1827, was at first directed against ships under all flags,
and ships arrested for breach of a pacific blockade were at
one time confiscated, as they would have been in time of
war. It has been purged of these defects as the result of
discussions, diplomatic and scientific. As now understood,
the blockade is enforced only against vessels belonging to
the &quot;quasi-enemy,&quot; and even such vessels, when arrested,
are not confiscated, but merely detained till the blockade
is raised. International law does not stand still; and having
some acquaintance with Continental opinion on the topic
under consideration, I read with amazement &quot;M.'s&quot; assertion
that &quot;the majority in number,&quot; &quot;the most weighty in
authority&quot; of the writers on international law &quot;have never
failed to protest against such practices as indefensible in
principle.&quot; The fact is that the objections made by, e.g.
Lord Palmerston in 1846, and by several writers of textbooks,
to pacific blockade, had reference to the abuses
connected with the earlier stages of its development. As
directed only against the ships of the &quot;quasi-enemy,&quot; it
has received the substantially unanimous approbation
of the Institut de Droit International at Heidelberg in
1887, after a very interesting debate, in which the advo<span class="newpage"><a name="page013" id="page013">[013]</a></span>cates
of the practice were led by M. Perels, of the Prussian
Admiralty, and its detractors by Professor Geffken. It is
true that in an early edition of his work upon international
law my lamented friend, Mr. Hall, did use the words attributed
to him by &quot;M.&quot;: &quot;It is difficult to see how a pacific
blockade is justifiable.&quot; But many things, notably Lord
Granville's correspondence with France in 1884 and the
blockade of the Greek coast in 1886, have occurred since
those words were written. If &quot;M.&quot; will turn to a later edition
of the work in question he will see that Mr. Hall had completely
altered his opinion on the subject, or rather that,
having disapproved of the practice as unreformed, he
blesses it altogether in its later development. With reference
to the utility of the practice, I should like to call the attention
of &quot;M.&quot; to a passage in the latest edition of Hall's book
which is perhaps not irrelevant to current politics:&mdash;</p>

<div class="letterquot"><p>&quot;The circumstances of the Greek blockade of 1886 show that
occasions may occur in which pacific blockade has an efficacy which no
other measure would possess. The irresponsible recklessness of Greece
was endangering the peace of the world; advice and threats had been
proved to be useless; it was not till the material evidence of the
blockade was afforded that the Greek imagination could be impressed
with the belief that the majority of the Great Powers of Europe were
in earnest in their determination that war should be avoided.&quot;</p></div>

<p class="lettertitle"><a name="THE-VENEZUELAN-CONTROVERSY" />THE VENEZUELAN CONTROVERSY</p>

<p>Sir,&mdash;Apart from the practical difficulty, so ably described
by Sir Robert Giffen in your issue of this morning, of
obtaining compensation in money from a State which seems
to be at once bankrupt and in the throes of revolution, not
a few questions of law and policy, as to which misunderstanding
is more than probable, are raised from day to day
by the action of the joint squadrons in Venezuelan waters.
It may therefore be worth while to attempt to disentangle
<span class="newpage"><a name="page014" id="page014">[014]</a></span>the more important of these questions from the rest, and to
indicate in each case the principles involved.</p>

<p>1. Are we at war with Venezuela? Till reading the
reports of what passed last night in the House of Commons,
I should have replied to this question unhesitatingly in
the negative. Most people whose attention has been
directed to such matters must have supposed that we were
engaged in the execution of &quot;reprisals,&quot; the nature and
legitimacy of which have long been recognised by international
law. They consist, of course, in the exertion of
pressure, short of war; over which they possess the following
advantages: They are strictly limited in scope; they
cease, when their object has been attained, without the
formalities of a treaty of peace; and, no condition of
&quot;belligerency&quot; existing between the Powers immediately
concerned, third Powers are not called upon to undertake
the onerous obligations of &quot;neutrality.&quot; The objection sometimes
made to reprisals, that they are applicable only to the
weaker Powers, since a strong Power would at once treat
them as acts of war, is indeed the strongest recommendation
of this mode of obtaining redress. To localise hostile
pressure as far as possible, and to give to it such a character
as shall restrict its incidence to the peccant State, is surely
in the interest of the general good. That the steps taken
are such as would probably, between States not unequally
matched, cause an outbreak of war cannot render them
inequitable in cases where so incalculable an evil is unlikely
to follow upon their employment.</p>

<p>2. The justification of a resort either to reprisals or to war,
in any given case, depends, of course, upon the nature of the
acts complained of, and upon the validity of the excuses put
forward either for the acts themselves, or for failure to give
satisfaction for them. The British claims against Venezuela
seem to fall into three classes. It will hardly be disputed
that acts of violence towards British subjects or vessels,
committed under State authority, call for redress. Losses
<span class="newpage"><a name="page015" id="page015">[015]</a></span>by British subjects in the course of civil wars would come
next, and would need more careful scrutiny (on this point
the debates and votes of the Institut de Droit International,
at its meeting at Neuch&acirc;tel in 1900, may be consulted with
advantage). Last of all would come the claims of unpaid
bondholders, as to which Mr. Balfour would seem to endorse,
in principle, the statement made in 1880 by Lord Salisbury
who, while observing that &quot;it would be an extreme assertion
to say that this country ought never to interfere on the part
of bondholders who have been wronged,&quot; went on to say that
&quot;it would be hardly fair if any body of capitalists should
have it in their power to pledge the people of this country
to exertions of such an extensive character.... They
would be getting the benefit of an English guarantee without
paying the price of it.&quot;</p>

<p>3. Reprisals may be exercised in many ways; from such
a high-handed act as the occupation of the Principalities by
Russia in 1853, to such a mere seizure of two or three
merchant vessels as occurred in the course of our controversy
with Brazil in 1861. In modern practice, these measures
imply a temporary sequestration, as opposed to confiscation
or destruction, of the property taken. In the belief that
reprisals only were being resorted to against Venezuela one
was therefore glad to hear that the sinking of gunboats by
the Germans had been explained as rendered necessary by
their unseaworthiness.</p>

<p>4. Pacific reprisals should also, according to the tendency
of modern opinion and practice, be so applied as not to
interfere with the interests of third Powers and their subjects.
This point has been especially discussed with reference to
that species of reprisal known as a &quot;pacific blockade,&quot; of
which some mention has been made in the present controversy.
The legitimacy of this operation, though dating only
from 1827, if properly applied, is open to no question. Its
earlier applications were, no doubt, unduly harsh, not only
towards the peccant State, but also towards third States,
<span class="newpage"><a name="page016" id="page016">[016]</a></span>the ships of which were even confiscated for attempting to
break a blockade of this nature. Two views on this subject
are now entertained&mdash;viz. (1) that the ships of third Powers
breaking a pacific blockade may be turned back with any
needful exertion of force, and, if need be, temporarily
detained; (2) that they may not be interfered with. The
former view is apparently that of the German Government.
It was certainly maintained by M. Perels, then as now the
adviser to the German Admiralty, during the discussion of
the subject by the Institut de Droit International at Heidelberg
in 1887. The latter view is that which was adopted by
the Institut on that occasion. It was maintained by Great
Britain, with reference to the French blockade of Formosa
in 1884; was acted on by the allied Powers in the blockade
of the coast of Greece, instituted in 1886; and is apparently
put forward by the United States at the present
moment.</p>

<p>5. If, however, we are at war with Venezuela (as will,
no doubt, be the case if we proclaim a belligerent blockade
of the coast, and may at any moment occur, should Venezuela
choose to treat our acts, even if intended only by way of
reprisals, as acts of war), the situation is changed in two
respects: (1) the hostilities which may be carried on by the
allies are no longer localised, or otherwise limited, except by
the dictates of humanity; (2) third States become <i>ipso facto</i>
&quot;neutrals,&quot; and, as such, subject to obligations to which up
to that moment they had not been liable. Whatever may
have previously been the case, it is thenceforth certain that
their merchant vessels must respect the (now belligerent)
blockade, and are liable to visit, search, seizure, and confiscation
if they attempt to break it.</p>

<p>6. If hostile pressure, whether by way of reprisals or of
war, is exercised by the combined forces of allies, the terms
on which this is to be done must obviously be arranged by
previous agreement. More especially would this be requisite
where, as in the case of Great Britain and Germany, different
<span class="newpage"><a name="page017" id="page017">[017]</a></span>views are entertained with reference to the acts which are
permissible under a &quot;pacific blockade.&quot;</p>

<p>7. When, besides the Power, or Powers, putting pressure
upon a given State, with a view to obtaining compensation
for injuries received from it, other Powers, though taking
no part in what is going on, give notice that they also
have claims against the same offender; delicate questions
may obviously arise between the creditors who have and
those who have not taken active steps to make their claims
effective. In the present instance, France is said to assert
that she has acquired a sort of prior mortgage on the assets
of Venezuela; and the United States, Spain, and Belgium
declare themselves entitled to the benefit of the &quot;most-favoured-nation
clause&quot; when those assets are made available
for creditors. What principles are applicable to the
solution of the novel questions suggested by these competing
claims?</p>

<p>8. It is satisfactory to know, on the highest authority,
that the &quot;Monroe doctrine&quot; is not intended to shield
American States against the consequences of their wrongdoing;
since the cordial approval of the doctrine which
has just been expressed by our own Government can only
be supposed to extend to it so far as it is reasonably defined
and applied. Great Britain, for one, has no desire for an
acre of new territory on the American continent. The
United States, on the other hand, will doubtless readily
recognise that, if international wrongs are to be redressed
upon that continent, aggrieved European Powers may
occasionally be obliged to resort to stronger measures than
a mere embargo on shipping, or the blockade (whether
&quot;pacific&quot; or &quot;belligerent&quot;) of a line of coast.</p>

<p class="lettertitle"><a name="THE-VENEZUELA-PROTOCOL" />THE VENEZUELA PROTOCOL</p>

<p>Sir,&mdash;The close (for the present, at any rate) of the
Venezuelan incident will be received with general satisfaction.
One of the articles of the so-called &quot;protocol&quot; of
February 18 seems, however, to point a moral which one
may hope will not be lost sight of in the future&mdash;<i>viz.</i> the
desirability of keeping unblurred the line of demarcation
between such unfriendly pressure as constitutes &quot;reprisals&quot;
and actual war.</p>

<p>After all that has occurred&mdash;statements in Parliament,
action of the Governor of Trinidad in bringing into operation
the dormant powers of the Supreme Court of the island as
a prize Court, &amp;c.&mdash;one would have supposed that there
could be no doubt, though no declaration had been issued,
that we were at war with Venezuela.</p>

<p>Our Government has, therefore, been well advised in
providing for the renewal of any treaty with that Power
which may have been abrogated by the war; but it is
curious to find that the article (7) of the protocol which
effects this desirable result begins by a recital to the effect
that &quot;it may be contended that the establishment of a
blockade of the Venezuelan ports by the British naval
forces has <i>ipso facto</i> created a state of war between Great
Britain and Venezuela.&quot;</p>

<p>It is surely desirable that henceforth Great Britain
should know, and that other nations should at least have
the means of knowing, for certain, whether she is at war or
at peace.</p>

<p>Sir,&mdash;Professor Westlake's interesting letter as to the
measures recently taken by the Netherlands Government in<span class="newpage"><a name="page019" id="page019">[019]</a></span>
Venezuelan waters opportunely recalls attention to a topic
upon which I addressed you when, six years ago, our own
Government was similarly engaged in putting pressure
upon Venezuela&mdash;<i>viz.</i> the desirability of drawing a clear
line between war and reprisals. Perhaps I may now be
allowed to return, very briefly, to this topic, with special
reference to Professor Westlake's remarks.</p>

<p>In any discussion of the questions involved, we ought,
I think, clearly to realise that The Hague Convention, No. iii.
of 1907, has no application to any measures not amounting
to war. The &quot;hostilities&quot; mentioned in Art. 1 of the
Convention are, it will be observed, exclusively such as
must not commence without either a &quot;declaration of war,&quot;
or &quot;an ultimatum with a conditional declaration of war&quot;;
and Art. 2 requires that the &quot;state of war&quot; thus created
shall be notified to &quot;neutral Powers.&quot; There are, of course,
no Powers answering to this description till war has actually
broken out. Neutrality presupposes belligerency. Any
other interpretation of the Convention would, indeed,
render &quot;pacific blockades&quot; henceforth impossible.</p>

<p>In the next place, we must at once recognise that the
application of the term &quot;reprisals,&quot; whatever may have
been its etymological history, must no longer be restricted
to seizure of property. It has now come to cover, and it
is the only term which does cover generically, an indeterminate
list of unfriendly acts, such as embargo, pacific
blockade, seizure of custom-houses, and even occupation of
territory, to which resort is had in order to obtain redress
from an offending State without going to war with it. The
pressure thus exercised, unlike the unlimited <i>licentia laedendi</i>
resulting from a state of war, is localised and graduated.
It abrogates no treaties, and terminates without a treaty
of peace. It affects only indirectly, if at all, the rights of
States which take no part in the quarrel.</p>

<p>The questions which remain for consideration would
seem to be the following:&mdash;<span class="newpage"><a name="page020" id="page020">[020]</a></span></p>

<p>1. Would it be feasible to draw up a definite list of the
measures which may legitimately be taken with a view to
exercising pressure short of war?&mdash;I think not. States
differ so widely in offensive power and vulnerability that
it would be hardly advisable thus to fetter the liberty of
action of a State which considers itself to have been
injured.</p>

<p>2. Ought it to be made obligatory that acts of reprisal
should be preceded, or accompanied, by a notification to
the State against which they are exercised that they are
reprisals and not operations of war?&mdash;This would seem to
be highly desirable; unless indeed it can be assumed that,
in pursuance of The Hague Convention of 1907, no war will
henceforth be commenced without declaration.</p>

<p>8. Ought a statement to the like effect to be made to
nations not concerned in the quarrel?&mdash;This would, doubtless,
be convenient, unless the non-receipt by them of any
notification of a &quot;state of war,&quot; in pursuance of the Convention,
could be supposed to render such a statement
superfluous.</p>

<p>On the ambiguous character sometimes attaching to
reprisals as now practised, I may perhaps refer to an
article in the <i>Law Quarterly Review</i> for 1903, entitled &quot;War
Sub Modo.&quot;</p>

<div class="postnotes"><p>The operations against Venezuela which were closed by the protocol
of February 13, 1903, had given rise to the enunciation of the so-called
&quot;Drago doctrine,&quot; in a despatch, addressed on December 29
of the preceding year, by the Argentine Minister for Foreign Affairs to
the Government of the United States, which asserts that &quot;public
indebtedness cannot justify armed intervention by a European Power,
much less material occupation by it of territory belonging to any
American nation.&quot; The reply of the United States declined to carry
the &quot;Monroe doctrine&quot; to this length, citing the passage in President
Roosevelt's message in which he says: &quot;We do not guarantee any
State against punishment, if it misconducts itself, provided such
<span class="newpage"><a name="page021" id="page021">[021]</a></span>punishment does not take the form of the acquisition of territory by
any non-American Power.&quot;</p>

<p>It is, however, now provided by The Hague Convention, No. ii.
of 1907, ratified by Great Britain on November 27, 1909, that &quot;the
contracting Powers have agreed not to have recourse to armed force
for the recovery of contractual debts, claimed from the Government
of a country by the Government of another country, as being due to
its subjects. This stipulation shall have no application when the
debtor State declines, or leaves unanswered, an offer of arbitration,
or, having accepted it, renders impossible the conclusion of the terms
of reference (<i>compromis</i>), or, after the arbitration, fails to comply
with the arbitral decision.&quot;<span class="newpage"><a name="page022" id="page022">[022]</a></span></p></div>

<p class="chaptertitle">STEPS TOWARDS A WRITTEN LAW OF WAR</p>


<div class="intronotes"><p>A large body of written International Law, with reference to the
conduct of warfare, has been, in the course of the last half-century,
and, more especially, in quite recent years, called into existence by
means of General Conventions, or Declarations, of which mention
must frequently be made in the following pages. Such are:&mdash;</p>

<p>(i.) With reference to war, whether on land or at sea: the Declaration
of St. Petersburg, of 1868, as to explosive bullets; the three
Hague Declarations of 1899 (of which the first was repeated in 1907),
as to projectiles from balloons, projectiles spreading dangerous gases,
and expanding bullets; The Hague Convention, No. iii. of 1907 as to
Declaration of War; all ratified by Great Britain, except the Declaration
of St. Petersburg, which was thought to need no ratification.</p>

<p>(ii.) With reference only to war on land: the Geneva Convention
of 1906 (superseding that of 1864) as to the sick and wounded, which
was generally ratified, though by Great Britain only in 1911 (it was
extended to maritime warfare by Conventions iii. of 1899 and x. of
1907, both ratified by Great Britain, <i>cf. infra</i>, <a href="#CHAPTER_VI_SECTION_10">Ch. VI. Section 10</a>); the
Hague Conventions of 1907, No. iv. (superseding the Convention of 1899)
as to the conduct of warfare, and No. v. as to neutrals, of which only
the former has as yet been ratified by Great Britain.</p>

<p>(iii.) With reference only to war at sea: the Declaration of Paris,
of 1856, supposed apparently to need no ratification (to which the
United States is now the only important Power which has not become
a party), as to privateering, combination of enemy and neutral property
and blockades; The Hague Conventions of 1907, No. vi. as to
enemy merchant vessels at outbreak, No. vii. as to conversion of
merchantmen into warships, No. viii. as to mines, No. ix. as to naval
bombardments, No. x. as to the sick and wounded, No. xi. as to captures,
No. xii. as to an International Prize Court, supplemented by the Convention
of 1910, No. xiii. as to neutrals. It must be observed that, of
these Conventions, Great Britain has ratified only vi., vii., viii., ix., and
x., the three last subject to reservations. The Declaration of London
of 1909, purporting to codify the laws of naval warfare as to blockade,
contraband, hostile assistance, destruction of prizes, change of flag,
<span class="newpage"><a name="page023" id="page023">[023]</a></span>enemy character, convoy, resistance and compensation, and so to
facilitate the working of the proposed International Prize Court, if,
and when, this Court should come into existence, has failed to obtain
ratification, as will be hereafter explained.</p>


<p>Concurrently with the efforts which have thus been made to ascertain
the laws of war by general diplomatic agreement, the way for
such agreement has been prepared by the labours of the Institut de
Droit International, and by the issue by several governments of
instructions addressed to their respective armies and navies.</p>

<p>The <i>Manuel des Lois de la Guerre sur Terre</i>, published by the
Institut in 1880, is the subject of the two letters which immediately
follow. Their insertion here, although the part in them of the present
writer is but small, may be justified by the fact that they set out a
correspondence which is at once interesting (especially from its bearing
upon the war of 1914) and not readily elsewhere accessible.</p>

<p>The remaining letters in this chapter relate to the <i>Naval War Code</i>,
issued by the Government of the United States in 1900, but withdrawn
in 1904, though still expressing the views of that Government, for
reasons specified in a note to the British <i>charg&eacute; d'affaires</i> at Washington
and printed in <i>Parl. Papers, Miscell.</i> No. 5 (1909), p. 8. The United
States, it will be remembered, were also the first Power to attempt a
codification of the laws of war on land, in their <i>Instructions for the
Government of Armies of the United States</i>, issued in 1863, and reissued
in 1898. Some information as to this and similar bodies of national
instructions may be found in the present writer's <i>Studies in International
Law</i>, 1898, p. 85. <i>Cf.</i> his <i>Manual of Naval Prize Law</i>, issued
by authority of the Admiralty in 1888, his <i>Handbook of the Laws and
Customs of War on Land</i>, issued by authority to the British Army in
1904, and his <i>The Laws of War on Land (written and unwritten)</i>, 1908.
The Institut de Droit International, which has been engaged for some
years upon the Law of War at Sea, by devoting the whole of its session
at Oxford, in 1913, to the discussion of the subject, produced a <i>Manuel
des Lois de la Guerre sur Mer</i>, framed in accordance with the now-accepted
view which sanctions the capture of enemy private property
at sea. It is to be followed by a manual framed in accordance with
the contrary view. <i>Cf.</i> the letters upon the <i>Declaration of London</i>,
in <a href="#CHAPTER_VII_SECTION_10">Ch. VII. Section 10</a>, <i>infra</i>.</p></div>

<p>Sir,&mdash;You may perhaps think that the accompanying
letter, recently addressed by Count von Moltke to Professor<span class="newpage"><a name="page024" id="page024">[024]</a></span>
Bluntschli, is of sufficient general interest to be inserted
in <i>The Times</i>. It was written with reference to the
Manual of the Laws of War which was adopted by the
Institut de Droit International at its recent session at
Oxford. The German text of the letter will appear in
a few days at Berlin. My translation is made from the
proof-sheets of the February number of the <i>Revue de
Droit International</i>, which will contain also Professor
Bluntschli's reply.</p>

</div>

<div class="quotedletter"><p>&quot;Berlin, Dec. 11, 1880.</p>

<p>&quot;You have been so good as to forward to me the manual published
by the Institut de Droit International, and you hope for my approval
of it. In the first place I fully appreciate the philanthropic effort to
soften the evils which result from war. Perpetual peace is a dream,
and it is not even a beautiful dream. War is an element in the order
of the world ordained by God. In it the noblest virtues of mankind
are developed; courage and the abnegation of self, faithfulness to duty,
and the spirit of sacrifice: the soldier gives his life. Without war the
world would stagnate, and lose itself in materialism.</p>

<p>&quot;I agree entirely with the proposition contained in the introduction
that a gradual softening of manners ought to be reflected also in the
mode of making war. But I go further, and think the softening of
manners can alone bring about this result, which cannot be attained
by a codification of the law of war. Every law presupposes an
authority to superintend and direct its execution, and international
conventions are supported by no such authority. What neutral
States would ever take up arms for the sole reason that, two Powers
being at war, the 'laws of war' had been violated by one or both of the
belligerents? For offences of that sort there is no earthly judge.
Success can come only from the religious moral education of individuals
and from the feeling of honour and sense of justice of commanders who
enforce the law and conform to it so far as the exceptional circumstances
of war permit.</p>

<p>&quot;This being so, it is necessary to recognise also that increased
humanity in the mode of making war has in reality followed upon the
gradual softening of manners. Only compare the horrors of the Thirty
Years' War with the struggles of modern times.</p>

<p>&quot;A great step has been made in our own day by the establishment
<span class="newpage"><a name="page025" id="page025">[025]</a></span>of compulsory military service, which introduces the educated classes
into armies. The brutal and violent element is, of course, still there,
but it is no longer alone, as once it was. Again, Governments have
two powerful means of preventing the worst kind of excesses&mdash;strict
discipline maintained in time of peace, so that the soldier has become
habituated to it, and care on the part of the department which provides
for the subsistence of troops in the field. If that care fails, discipline
can only be imperfectly maintained. It is impossible for the soldier
who endures sufferings, hardships, fatigues, who meets danger, to
take only 'in proportion to the resources of the country.' He must
take whatever is needful for his existence. We cannot ask him for
what is superhuman.</p>

<p>&quot;The greatest kindness in war is to bring it to a speedy conclusion.
It should be allowable with that view to employ all methods save those
which are absolutely objectionable ('dazu m&uuml;ssen alle nicht geradezu
verwerfliche Mittel freistehen'). I can by no means profess agreement
with the Declaration of St. Petersburg when it asserts that 'the weakening
of the military forces of the enemy' is the only lawful procedure
in war. No, you must attack all the resources of the enemy's Government:
its finances, its railways, its stores, and even its prestige. Thus
energetically, and yet with a moderation previously unknown, was the
late war against France conducted. The issue of the campaign was
decided in two months, and the fighting did not become embittered till
a revolutionary Government, unfortunately for the country, prolonged
the war for four more months.</p>

<p>&quot;I am glad to see that the manual, in clear and precise articles,
pays more attention to the necessities of war than has been paid by
previous attempts. But for Governments to recognise these rules will
not be enough to insure that they shall be observed. It has long been
a universally recognised custom of warfare that a flag of truce must not
be fired on, and yet we have seen that rule violated on several occasions
during the late war.</p>

<p>&quot;Never will an article learnt by rote persuade soldiers to see a
regular enemy (sections 2-4) in the unorganised population which takes
up arms 'spontaneously' (so of its own motion) and puts them in
danger of their life at every moment of day and night. Certain requirements
of the manual might be impossible of realisation; for instance,
the identification of the slain after a great battle. Other requirements
would be open to criticism did not the intercalation of such words as
'if circumstances permit,' 'if possible,' 'if it can be done,' 'if necessary,'
give them an elasticity but for which the bonds they impose must
be broken by inexorable reality.</p>

<p>&quot;I am of opinion that in war, where everything must be individual,
the only articles which will prove efficacious are those which are
addressed specifically to commanders. Such are the rules of the
<span class="newpage"><a name="page026" id="page026">[026]</a></span>manual relating to the wounded, the sick, the surgeons, and medical
appliances. The general recognition of these principles, and of those
also which relate to prisoners, would mark a distinct step of progress
towards the goal pursued with so honourable a persistency by the
Institut de Droit International.</p>

VON MOLTKE</p>

<p>Sir,&mdash;In accordance with a wish expressed in several
quarters, I send you, on the chance of your being able to
make room for it, a translation of Professor Bluntschli's
reply to the letter from Count von Moltke which appeared
in <i>The Times</i> of the 1st inst.</p>

</div>

<div class="quotedletter"><p>&quot;Christmas, 1880.</p>

<p>&quot;I am very grateful for your Excellency's detailed and kind statement
of opinion as to the manual of the laws of war. This statement
invites serious reflections. I see in it a testimony of the highest value,
of historical importance; and I shall communicate it forthwith to
the members of the Institut de Droit International.</p>

<p>&quot;For the present I do not think I can better prove my gratitude
to your Excellency than by sketching the reasons which have guided
our members, and so indicating the nature of the different views which
prevail upon the subject.</p>

<p>&quot;It is needless to say that the same facts present themselves in a
different light and give a different impression as they are looked at from
the military or the legal point of view. The difference is diminished,
but not removed, when an illustrious general from his elevated position
takes also into consideration the great moral and political duties of
States, and when, on the other hand, the representatives of science
of international law set themselves to bring legal principles into relation
with military necessities.</p>

<p>&quot;For the man of arms the interest of the safety and success of the
army will always take precedence of that of the inoffensive population,
while the jurist, convinced that law is the safeguard of all, and especially
for the weak against the strong, will ever feel it a duty to secure for
private individuals in districts occupied by an enemy the indispensable
<span class="newpage"><a name="page027" id="page027">[027]</a></span>protection of law. There may be members of the Institut who do not
give up the hope that some day, thanks to the progress of civilisation,
humanity will succeed in substituting an organised international justice
for the wars which now-a-days take place between sovereign States.
But the body of the Institut, as a whole, well knows that that hope has
no chance of being realised in our time, and limits its action in this
matter to two principal objects, the attainment of which is possible:&mdash;</p>

<p>&quot;1. To open and facilitate the settlement of trifling disputes between
nations by judicial methods, war being unquestionably a method out
of all proportion in such cases.</p>

<p>&quot;2. To aid in elucidating and strengthening legal order even in
time of war.</p>

<p>&quot;I acknowledge unreservedly that the customs of warfare have
improved since the establishment of standing armies, a circumstance
which has rendered possible a stricter discipline, and has necessitated
a greater care for the provisionment of troops. I also acknowledge
unreservedly that the chief credit for this improvement is due to military
commanders. Brutal and barbarous pillage was prohibited by
generals before jurists were convinced of its illegality. If in our own
day a law recognised by the civilised world forbids, in a general way,
the soldier to make booty in warfare on land, we have here a great
advance in civilisation, and the jurists have had their share in bringing
it about. Since compulsory service has turned standing armies into
national armies, war has also become national. Laws of war are consequently
more than ever important and necessary, since, in the differences
of culture and opinion which prevail between individuals and
classes, law is almost the only moral power the force of which is acknowledged
by all, and which binds all together under common rules. This
pleasing and cheering circumstance is one which constantly meets us
in the Institut de Droit International. We see a general legal persuasion
ever in process of more and more distinct formation uniting
all civilised peoples. Men of nations readily disunited and opposed&mdash;Germans
and French, English and Russians, Spaniards and Dutchmen,
Italians and Austrians&mdash;are, as a rule, all of one mind as to the principles
of international law.</p>

<p>&quot;This is what makes it possible to proclaim an international law
of war, approved by the legal conscience of all civilised peoples; and
when a principle is thus generally accepted, it exerts an authority over
minds and manners which curbs sensual appetites and triumphs over
barbarism. We are well aware of the imperfect means of causing its
decrees to be respected and carried out which are at the disposal of the
law of nations. We know also that war, which moves nations so deeply,
rouses to exceptional activity the good qualities as well as the evil
instincts of human nature. It is for this very reason that the jurist is
impelled to present the legal principles, of the need for which he is
<span class="newpage"><a name="page028" id="page028">[028]</a></span>convinced, in a clear and precise form, to the feeling of justice of the
masses, and to the legal conscience of those who guide them. He is
persuaded that his declaration will find a hearing in the conscience of
those whom it principally concerns, and a powerful echo in the public
opinion of all countries.</p>

<p>&quot;The duty of seeing that international law is obeyed, and of punishing
violations of it, belongs, in the first instance, to States, each within
the limits of its own supremacy. The administration of the law of
war ought therefore to be intrusted primarily to the State which wields
the public power in the place where an offence is committed. No State
will lightly, and without unpleasantness and danger, expose itself to a
just charge of having neglected its international duties; it will not do
so even when it knows that it runs no risk of war on the part Of neutral
States. Every State, even the most powerful, will gain sensibly in
honour with God and man if it is found to be faithful and sincere in
respect and obedience to the law of nations.</p>

<p>&quot;Should we be deceiving ourselves if we admitted that a belief in
the law of nations, as in a sacred and necessary authority, ought to
facilitate the enforcement of discipline in the Army and help to prevent
many faults and many harmful excesses? I, for my part, am convinced
that the error, which has been handed down to us from antiquity,
according to which all law is suspended during war, and everything is
allowable against the enemy nation&mdash;that this abominable error can
but increase the unavoidable sufferings and evils of war without necessity,
and without utility from the point of view of that energetic way
of making war which I also think is the right way.</p>

<p>&quot;With reference to several rules being stated with the qualifications
'if possible,' 'according to circumstances,' we look on this as a safety-valve,
intended to preserve the inflexible rule of law from giving way
when men's minds are overheated in a struggle against all sorts of
dangers, and so to insure the application of the rules in many other
instances. Sad experience teaches us that in every war there are
numerous violations of law which must unavoidably remain unpunished,
but this will not cause the jurist to abandon the authoritative principle
which has been violated. Quite the reverse. If, for instance, a flag of
truce has been fired upon, in contravention of the law of nations, the
jurist will uphold and proclaim more strongly than ever the rule that
a flag of truce is inviolable.</p>

<p>&quot;I trust that your Excellency will receive indulgently this sincere
statement of my views, and will regard it as an expression of my
gratitude, as well as of my high personal esteem and of my respectful
consideration.</p>

<p class="lettertitle"><a name="THE-UNITED-STATES-NAVAL-WAR-CODE" />THE UNITED STATES NAVAL WAR CODE.<a class="fnanchor" id="footnotetag01" name="footnotetag01" href=
  "#footnote01">1</a></p>

<p>Sir,&mdash;The &quot;Naval War Code&quot; of the United States,
upon which an interesting article appeared in <i>The Times</i> of
Friday last, in so well deserving of attention in this country
that I may perhaps be allowed to supplement the remarks of
your Correspondent from the results of a somewhat minute
examination of the code made shortly after its publication.</p>

<p>One notes, in the first place, that the Government of
the United States does not shirk responsibility. It puts
the code into the hands of its officers &quot;for the government
of all persons attached to the naval service,&quot; and is doubtless
prepared to stand by the rules contained in it, as being in
accordance with international law. These rules deal boldly
with even so disagreeable a topic as &quot;Reprisals&quot; (Art. 8),
upon which the Brussels, and after it The Hague, Conference
preferred to keep silence; and they take a definite line on
many questions upon which there are wide differences of
opinion. On most debatable points, the rules are in accordance
with the views of this country&mdash;<i>e.g.</i> as to the right of
search (Art. 22), as to the two-fold list of contraband
(Arts. 34-36), as to the moment at which the liability of a
blockade-runner commences (Art. 44), and as to the capture
of private property (Art. 14), although the prohibition of
such capture has long been favoured by the Executive of
the United States, and was advocated by the American
delegates at The Hague Conference. So also Arts. 34-36, by
apparently taking for granted the correctness of the rulings
of the Supreme Court in the Civil War cases of the <i>Springbok</i>
and the <i>Peterhoff</i> with reference to what may be described
as &quot;continuous carriage,&quot; are in harmony with the views
which Lord Salisbury recently had occasion to express as to
the trade of the <i>Bundesrath</i> and other German vessels with
Lorenzo Marques. It must be observed, on the other
hand, that Art. 30 flatly contradicts the British rule as to
<span class="newpage"><a name="page030" id="page030">[030]</a></span>convoy; while Art. 3 sets out The Hague Declaration as
to projectiles dropped from balloons, to which this country
is not a party. Art. 7 departs from received views by
prohibiting altogether the use of false colours, and Art. 14
(doubtless in pursuance of the recent decision of the Supreme
Court in the <i>Paquete Habana</i>), by affirming the absolute
immunity of coast fishing vessels, as such, from capture.</p>

<p>On novel questions the code is equally ready with a
solution. It speaks with no uncertain voice on the treatment
of mail steamers and mail-bags (Art. 20). On cable-cutting
it adopts in Art. 5, as your Correspondent points
out, the views which I ventured to maintain in your columns
when the question was raised during the war of 1898.<a class="fnanchor" id="footnotetag02" name="footnotetag02" href=
  "#footnote02">2</a> I
may also, by the way, claim the support of the code for the
view taken by me, in a, correspondence also carried on in
your columns during the naval manoeuvres of 1888, of the
bombardment of open coast towns.<a class="fnanchor" id="footnotetag03" name="footnotetag03" href=
  "#footnote03">3</a> Art. 4 sets out substantially
the rules upon this subject for which I secured the
<i>imprimatur</i> of the Institut de Droit International in 1896.</p>

<p>Secondly, the code is so well brought up to date as to
incorporate (Arts. 21-29) the substance of The Hague
Convention, ratified only in September last, for applying
to maritime warfare the principles of the Convention of
Geneva. Art. 10 of The Hague Convention has been reproduced
in the code, in forgetfulness perhaps of the fact
that that article has not been ratified.</p>

<p>Thirdly, the code contains, very properly, some general
provisions applicable equally to warfare upon land (Arts.
1, 3, 8, 12, 54).</p>

<p>Fourthly, it is clearly expressed; and it is brief, consisting
of only 54 articles, occupying 22 pages.</p>

<p>Fifthly, it deals with two very distinct topics&mdash;<i>viz.</i> the
mode of conducting hostilities against the forces of the
enemy, and the principles applicable to the making prize
of merchant vessels, which as often as not may be the
<span class="newpage"><a name="page031" id="page031">[031]</a></span>property of neutrals. These topics are by no means kept
apart as they might be, articles on prize occurring unexpectedly
in the section avowedly devoted to hostilities.</p>

<p>It is worth considering whether something resembling
the United States code would not be found useful in the
British Navy. Our code might be better arranged than
its predecessor, and would differ from it on certain questions,
but should resemble it in clearness of expression, in brevity,
and, above all things, in frank acceptance of responsibility.
What naval men most want is definite guidance, in
categorical language, upon those points of maritime international
law upon which our Government has made up its
own mind.</p>

<p class="lettertitle"><a name="A-NAVAL-WAR-CODE" />A NAVAL WAR CODE</p>

<p>Sir,&mdash;It is now nearly a year ago since I ventured to
suggest in your columns (for April 10, 1901) that something
resembling the United States &quot;Naval War Code,&quot; dealing
with &quot;the laws and usages of war at sea,&quot; would be found
useful in the British Navy.</p>

<p>The matter is, however, not quite so simple as might be
inferred from some of the allusions to it which occurred
during last night's debate upon the Navy Estimates. Upon
several disputable and delicate questions the Government
of the United States has not hesitated to express definite
views; and they are not always views which the Government
of our own country would be prepared to endorse.
For some remarks upon these questions in detail, and upon
the code generally, I must refer to my former letter, but
may perhaps be allowed to quote its concluding words,
which were to the following effect:&mdash;</p>

<div class="letterquot"><p>&quot;Our code might be better arranged than its predecessor, and would
differ from it on certain questions, but should resemble it in clearness
<span class="newpage"><a name="page032" id="page032">[032]</a></span>of expression, in brevity, and, above all things, in frank acceptance of
responsibility. What naval men most want is definite guidance, in
categorical language, upon those points of maritime international law
upon which our Government has made up its own mind.&quot;</p></div>

<p>Before issuing such a code our authorities would have
to decide&mdash;first, what are the classes of topics as to which
it is desirable to give definite instructions to naval officers;
and, secondly, with reference to topics, to be included in
the instructions, as to which there exist international differences
of view, what is, in each case, the view by which the
British Government is prepared to stand.</p>

<p>Sir,&mdash;Demands for the punishment of the ex-Kaiser
have produced many &quot;curiosities of literature,&quot; sometimes
even over the signatures of men deservedly respected as
authorities upon subjects which they have made their own;
but <i>ne sutor supra crepidam</i>. A.B.,<a class="fnanchor" id="footnotetag04a" name="footnotetag04a" href=
  "#footnote04">4</a> for instance, wrote of
the Kaiser as guilty of &quot;an indictable offence.&quot; X.Y.<a class="fnanchor" id="footnotetag04b" name="footnotetag04b" href=
  "#footnote04">4</a>
naturally protests against this misuse of terminology, which
is, indeed, far more specifically erroneous than was the
popular application, which you allowed me to criticise, of
the terms &quot;murder&quot; and &quot;piracy&quot; to certain detestable
acts perpetrated under Government authority.<a class="fnanchor" id="footnotetag05" name="footnotetag05" href="#footnote05">5</a> He goes
on to give an elaborate, though perhaps hardly necessary,
explanation that breaches of that generally accepted body
of rules to be followed by States <i>inter se</i>, which is known
as &quot;international law,&quot; can be enforced, in the last resort,
<span class="newpage"><a name="page034" id="page034">[034]</a></span>only by hostile State action&mdash;a fact which he seems to
suppose may entitle him to qualify the rules as &quot;a
mockery.&quot;</p>

<p>X.Y.<a class="fnanchor" id="footnotetag04c" name="footnotetag04c" href=
  "#footnote04">4</a> then proceeds to give an account of the so-called
&quot;private international law&quot; which surely needs revision
for the benefit of any &quot;man in the street&quot; who may care
to hear about it. X.Y.<a class="fnanchor" id="footnotetag04d" name="footnotetag04d" href=
  "#footnote04">4</a> defines it as &quot;that part of the law
of each separate country, as administered in its own Courts,
which deals with international matters,&quot; and he enumerates
as such matters &quot;prize, contraband, blockade, the rights
of ambassadors.&quot; In fact none of these matters are within
the scope of &quot;private international law,&quot; but are governed
by &quot;(public) international law,&quot; non-compliance with which
by the Courts or subjects of any State is ground of complaint
for the Government of any other State thereby wrongfully
affected.</p>

<p>The so-called &quot;private international law,&quot; better
described as &quot;the conflict of laws,&quot; deals, in reality, with
the rules which the Courts of each country apply, apart
from any international obligation, to the solution of
questions, usually between private litigants, in which doubt
may arise as to the national law by which a given transaction
ought to be governed&mdash;<i>e.g.</i> with reference to a contract
made in France, but to be performed in England. There
is here a &quot;conflict,&quot; or &quot;collision,&quot; of laws, and it is decided
in accordance with rules adopted in the country in which
the litigation occurs. These rules have no &quot;international&quot;
validity, and the term is applied to them, merely in a popular
way, to indicate that a Court may have in some cases
to apply the law of a country other than that in which
it is sitting. The unfortunate opposition of &quot;public&quot; to
&quot;private&quot; international law has to answer for much confusion
of thought. &quot;International law,&quot; properly so called,
has, of course, no need to be described as &quot;public&quot; to
distinguish it from rules for solving the &quot;conflicts&quot; of
<span class="newpage"><a name="page035" id="page035">[035]</a></span>private laws, which are &quot;international&quot; rules only in the
sense that laws are sometimes applied in countries other
than those in which they are primarily binding.</p>

<div class="intronotes"><p>Not a few International Conventions necessitate, before they can
be ratified, in order that their provisions may be carried into effect, a
certain amount of municipal legislation.</p>

<p>The letters which follow are concerned with some measures introduced
into the British Parliament for this purpose, relating respectively
to Naval Prize, to the Geneva Convention of 1906, and to Conventions
signed at The Hague Peace Conference of 1907. It is with criticisms
of Bills dealing with the last-mentioned topic that this chapter is
mainly occupied.</p></div>


<p class="lettertitle"><a name="GOVERNMENT-BILLS-AND-INTERNATIONAL-CONVENTIONS" />GOVERNMENT BILLS AND INTERNATIONAL
CONVENTIONS</p>

<p>Sir,&mdash;You have already allowed me to point out how
singularly ill-adapted is the resuscitated &quot;Naval Prize
Consolidation Bill&quot;<a class="fnanchor" id="footnotetag06" name="footnotetag06" href="#footnote06">6</a> to inform Parliament upon the highly
technical points as to which a vote in favour of the Bill
might be supposed to imply approval of the Government
policy.</p>

<p>Two other Bills have now been presented to the House
of Commons in such a shape as to raise a doubt whether
the wish of the Government, or of the draftsman, has been
that the topics to which they relate shall be discussed <i>en
pleine connaissance de cause</i>.</p>

<p>The &quot;Geneva Convention Bill&quot;<a class="fnanchor" id="footnotetag07" name="footnotetag07" href="#footnote07">7</a> is intended to facilitate
<span class="newpage"><a name="page037" id="page037">[037]</a></span>the withdrawal of reservations subject to which the Convention
was ratified by Great Britain. These reservations,
upon which I insisted at Geneva, somewhat to the surprise
of my French and Russian colleagues, relate to Arts. 23, 27,
and 28 of the Convention, one of the effects of which would
have been to impose upon our Government an obligation
to carry through, within five years, an Act of Parliament,
making the employment of the Geneva emblem or name,
except for military purposes, a criminal offence. Any one
who knows something of the difficulties which beset legislation
in this country, especially where commercial interests
are involved, will see that the performance of such an undertaking
might well have proved to be impossible. Though
myself strongly in favour of placing, at the proper time and
in an appropriate manner, legislative restrictions upon the
general use of the emblem and name, I can hardly think
the Bill now before Parliament to be well adapted for its
purpose. The &quot;Memorandum&quot; prefixed to it ought surely
to have stated, in plain language, the effect of the articles
in question and the reasons which prevented them from
being ratified together with the rest of the Convention.
Instead of this, only one of those articles is cited, and few
members of Parliament will be aware that an omitted paragraph
of that article requires that the use of the emblem
or name should be penalised by British law at the latest
five years and six months from the date of the British ratification,
which was deposited on April 16, 1907&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, not
later than October 16, 1912. This requirement is not
satisfied by the Bill, which, even if passed in the present
Session, would preserve intact till 1915 the rights of proprietors
of trade-marks, while somewhat harshly rendering
forthwith illegal the user of the emblem or name by all other
persons.</p>

<p>On the drafting of the &quot;Second Peace Conference Conventions
Bill,&quot; I will only remark that neither in the preamble
nor elsewhere is any information vouchsafed as to the<span class="newpage"><a name="page038" id="page038">[038]</a></span>
Conventions, out of thirteen drafted at The Hague, which
are within the purview of the Bill. The reader is left to
puzzle out for himself, supposing him to have the necessary
materials at hand, that certain clauses of the Bill relate
respectively to certain articles which must be looked for
in the Conventions numbered I., V., X., XII., and XIII.</p>

<p>Sir,&mdash;In reintroducing their Bill &quot;to make such amendments
in the law as are necessary in order to enable certain
conventions to be carried into effect,&quot; the Government has
justified the criticisms which I addressed to you upon the
way in which this measure was first presented to Parliament.</p>

<p>I pointed out that neither in the preamble nor elsewhere
was any information vouchsafed as to which of
&quot;the various conventions drawn up at the second Peace
Conference&quot; were within the purview of the Bill. Still
less was any clue given to those articles, out of nearly 400
contained in the 13 conventions in question, which are relevant
to the proposed legislation. Members of Parliament
sufficiently inquisitive not to be inclined to take the measure
on trust, were left to puzzle out all this for themselves,
but proved so restive under the treatment that the Bill,
which was introduced in June, 1911, had to be withdrawn
in the following December.</p>

<p>As now resuscitated, the Bill is accompanied by a
memorandum containing information which will enable
<span class="newpage"><a name="page039" id="page039">[039]</a></span>the reader, even though no specialist, supposing him to
have the necessary documents at hand, though probably
only after several hours of labour, to ascertain what would
be the result of passing it. Is it too much to hope that
similar aids to the understanding of complicated legislative
proposals will be systematically provided in the future?</p>

<p class="lettertitle"><a name="THE-FOREIGN-ENLISTMENT-BILL" />THE FOREIGN ENLISTMENT BILL</p>

<p>Sir,&mdash;It is doubtless the case, as stated in your leading
article of to-day, that the Foreign Enlistment Bill has not
received the attention which it deserves. It may perhaps
be worth while to mention, as affording some explanation
of this neglect, the fact that the memorandum prefixed
to the Bill vaguely describes its main object as being to
bring our law into conformity with &quot;The Hague Conventions&quot;
at large. An ordinary member of Parliament would
surely be grateful to be referred specifically to Convention
No. xiii., Arts. 8, 17, and 25. He might well shrink from
the labour of exploring the hundreds of articles contained
in &quot;The Hague Conventions&quot; in order to ascertain which
of the articles suggest some modification of the English
statute.</p>

<p>I would also venture to suggest that, in Article 1 (1) (b)
of the Bill the words &quot;or allows to depart,&quot; carried over
from the old Act, should be omitted, as of doubtful interpretation.
Would it not also be desirable to take this
opportunity of severing the enlistment articles of the overgrown
principal Act from those forbidding the despatch of
<span class="newpage"><a name="page040" id="page040">[040]</a></span>ships fitted for hostilities and restricting the hospitality
which may be extended to belligerent war ships?</p>

<p>Upon quite a different subject, I should like to answer
the question propounded in your article, as to the weight
now to be given to the Declaration of London, by saying
that no weight should be given to it, except as between
Powers who may have ratified it or may have agreed to be
temporarily bound by its provisions. One has of late been
surprised to read of vessels carrying contraband being
allowed to continue their voyage after surrendering the
contraband goods, in accordance with a new rule suggested
by the Declaration, whereas, under still existing international
law, the duty of a captor is to bring in the vessel
together with her cargo, in order that the rightfulness of
the seizure may be investigated by a Prize Court.</p>

<p class="subsectionhead">Declaration of War</p>

<div class="intronotes"><p>The following letter bears upon the question, much discussed in
recent years, of the lawfulness of hostilities commenced without
anything amounting to a declaration of war. Although several
modern wars, <i>e.g.</i> the Franco-Prussian of 1870, and the Russo-Turkish
of 1877, were preceded by declaration, it was hardly possible, in view
of the practice of the last two centuries, to maintain, that this was
required by international law, and it has never been alleged that any
definite interval need intervene between a declaration and the first
act of hostilities. On the destruction of the <i>Kowshing</i>, the present
writer may further refer to his <i>Studies in International Law</i>, 1898,
p. 126, and to Professor Takahashi's <i>International Law during the Chino-Japanese
War</i>, 1899, pp. 24, 192. But see now the note at the end
of the &quot;Letter&quot; which follows.</p></div>


<p class="lettertitle"><a name="THE-SINKING-OF-THE-KOWSHING" />THE SINKING OF THE <i>KOWSHING</i></p>

<p>Sir,&mdash;The words of soberness and truth were spoken
with reference to the sinking of the <i>Kowshing</i> in the letter
from Professor Westlake which you printed on Friday last.
Ignorance dies hard, or, after the appearance of that letter
and of your remarks upon it, one might have expected that
leading articles would be less lavishly garnished with such
phrases as &quot;act of piracy,&quot; &quot;war without declaration,&quot;
&quot;insult to the British flag,&quot; &quot;condign punishment of the
Japanese commander.&quot; But these flowers of speech continue
to blossom; and, now that the facts of the case seem
<span class="newpage"><a name="page042" id="page042">[042]</a></span>to be established beyond reasonable doubt by the telegrams
of this morning, I should be glad to be allowed to state
shortly what I believe will be the verdict of international
law upon what has occurred.</p>

<p>If the visiting, and eventual sinking, of the <i>Kowshing</i>
occurred in time of peace, or in time of war before she had
notice that war had broken out, a gross outrage has taken
place. But the facts are otherwise.</p>

<p>In the first place, a state of war existed. It is trite
knowledge, and has been over and over affirmed by Courts,
both English and American, that a war may legally commence
with a hostile act on one side, not preceded by
declaration. How frequently this has occurred in practice
may be seen from a glance at an historical statement prepared
for the War Office by Colonel Maurice <i>&agrave; propos</i> of the
objections to a Channel tunnel. Whether or no hostilities
had previously occurred upon the mainland, I hold that the
acts of the Japanese commander in boarding the <i>Kowshing</i>
and threatening her with violence in case of disobedience
to his orders were acts of war.</p>

<p>In the second place, the <i>Kowshing</i> had notice of the
existence of a war, at any rate from the moment when she
received the orders of the Japanese commander.</p>

<p>The <i>Kowshing</i>, therefore, before the first torpedo was
fired, was, and knew that she was, a neutral ship engaged
in the transport service of a belligerent. (Her flying the
British flag, whether as a <i>ruse de guerre</i> or otherwise, is
wholly immaterial.) Her liabilities, as such ship, were
twofold:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. Regarded as an isolated vessel, she was liable to
be stopped, visited, and taken in for adjudication by a
Japanese Prize Court. If, as was the fact, it was practically
impossible for a Japanese prize crew to be placed on board
of her, the Japanese commander was within his rights, in
using any amount of force necessary to compel her to obey
his orders.<span class="newpage"><a name="page043" id="page043">[043]</a></span></p>

<p>2. As one of a fleet of transports and men-of-war engaged
in carrying reinforcements to the Chinese troops on the
mainland, the <i>Kowshing</i> was clearly part of a hostile expedition,
or one which might be treated as hostile, which the
Japanese were entitled, by the use of all needful force, to
prevent from reaching its destination.</p>

<p>The force employed seems not to have been in excess of
what might lawfully be used, either for the arrest of an
enemy's neutral transport or for barring the progress of a
hostile expedition. The rescued officers also having been
set at liberty in due course, I am unable to see that any
violation of the rights of neutrals has occurred. No apology
is due to our Government, nor have the owners of the
<i>Kowshing</i>, or the relatives of any of her European officers
who may have been lost, any claim for compensation. I
have said nothing about the violation by the Japanese of
the usages of civilised warfare (not of the Geneva Convention,
which has no bearing upon the question), which
would be involved by their having fired upon the Chinese
troops in the water; not only because the evidence upon
this point is as yet insufficient, but also because the grievance,
if established, would affect only the rights of the Belligerents
<i>inter se</i>; not the rights of neutrals, with which alone this
letter is concerned. I have also confined my observations
to the legal aspects of the question, leaving to others to
test the conduct of the Japanese commander by the rules
of chivalrous dealing or of humanity.</p>

<div class="postnotes"><p>The controversy caused by the sinking of the <i>Kowshing</i> in 1894
was revived by the manner of the Japanese attack upon Port Arthur,
in 1904 (see Professor Takahashi's <i>International Law applied to the
Russo-Japanese War</i>, 1908, p. 1), and led to a careful study of the subject
by a committee of the Institut de Droit International, resulting in the
adoption by the Institut, at its Ghent Meeting in 1906, of the following
resolutions:&mdash;<span class="newpage"><a name="page044" id="page044">[044]</a></span></p>

<p>(1) &quot;It is in conformity with the requirements of International
law, to the loyalty which the nations owe to one another in their,
mutual relations, as well as to the general interests of all States, that
hostilities ought not to commence without previous and unequivocal
warning.</p>

<p>(2) &quot;This warning may be given either in the shape of a declaration
of war pure and simple, or in the shape of an ultimatum duly notified
to the adversary by the State which wishes to begin the war.</p>

<p>(3) &quot;Hostilities must not commence until after the expiration of
a delay which would suffice to prevent the rule as to a previous and
unequivocal warning from being thought to be evaded.&quot; See the
<i>Annuaire de l'Institut</i>, t, xxi. p. 292.</p>

<p>In accordance with the principles underlying the first and second
of these resolutions, The Hague Convention, No. iii. of 1907 (ratified
generally by Great Britain on November 27, 1909), has now laid
down as a principle of International Law, binding upon the contracting
Powers, that&mdash;</p>

<p>(1) &quot;Hostilities between them ought not to commence without
a warning previously given and unequivocal, in the form either of a
reasoned declaration of war, or of an ultimatum, with a conditional
declaration of war.&quot;</p>

<p>And the Convention goes on to provide that&mdash;</p>

<p>(2) &quot;The state of war ought to be notified without delay to neutral
Powers, and shall be of no effect with reference to them, until after a
notification, which may be made even telegraphically. Nevertheless,
neutral Powers may not plead absence of notification, if it has been
shown beyond question that they were in fact cognisant of the state of
war.&quot; Any reference to the need of an interval between declaration
and the first act of hostility (such as is contained in the third of the
resolutions of the Institut) was deliberately omitted from the Convention,
although a declaration immediately followed by an attack
would obviously be of little service to the party attacked. (See the
present writer's <i>Laws of War on Land (written and unwritten)</i>, 1908,
P. 18.)</p></div>

<p>Sir,&mdash;The question raised last night by Mr. Arnold-Forster
is one which calls for more careful consideration
than it appears yet to have received. International law
has in modern times spoken with no very certain voice as
to the permissible treatment of alien enemies found within
the territory of a belligerent at the outbreak of war.</p>

<p>There is, however, little doubt that such persons,
although now more usually allowed to remain, during good
behaviour, may be expelled, and, if necessary, wholesale, as
were Germans from France in 1870. But may such persons
be, for good reasons, arrested, or otherwise prevented from
leaving the country, as Germans were prevented from
leaving France in the earlier days of the Franco-Prussian
War? Grotius speaks with approval of such a step being
taken, &quot;ad minuendas hostium vires.&quot; Bynkershoek,
more than a century later, recognises the right of thus
acting, &quot;though it is rarely exercised.&quot; So the Supreme
Court of the United States in <i>Brown v. United States</i>
(1814). So Chancellor Kent (1826), and Mr. Manning
(1889) is explicit that the arrest in question is lawful, and
that &quot;the individuals are prisoners of war.&quot;</p>

<p><span class="newpage"><a name="page046" id="page046">[046]</a></span>Vattel, is it true (1758), ventures to lay down that&mdash;</p>

<div class="letterquot"><p>&quot;Le Souverain qui d&eacute;clare la guerre ne peut retenir les sujets de
ennemi qui se trouvent dans ses &eacute;tats au moment de la d&eacute;claration
... en leur permettant d'entrer dans ses terres et d'y s&eacute;journer, il leur
a promis tacitement toute libert&eacute; et toute s&ucirc;ret&eacute; pour le retour.&quot;</p></div>

<p>And he has been followed by some recent writers. There
is, however, I venture to hold, no ground for asserting that
this indulgent system is imposed by international law.
I am glad, therefore, to find the Attorney-General laying
down that&mdash;</p>

<div class="letterquot"><p>&quot;for strictly military reasons, any nation is entitled to detain and to
intern soldiers found upon the territory at the outbreak of war.&quot;</p></div>

<p>And I should be surprised if, under all circumstances,
as the learned Attorney-General seems to think probable&mdash;</p>

<div class="letterquot"><p>&quot;England would follow, whatever the strict law may be, the humane
and chivalrous practice of modern times, and would give to any subjects
of a hostile Power who might be found here engaging in civilian pursuits
a reasonable time within which to leave for their own country, even
although they were under the obligation of entering for service under
the enemy's flag.&quot;</p></div>

<p>The doctrine of Vattel has, in fact, become less plausible
than it was before universal liability to military service had
become the rule in most Continental countries. The peaceably
engaged foreign resident is now in all probability a
trained soldier, and liable to be recalled to the flag of a
possible enemy.</p>

<p>There may, of course, be considerable practical difficulties
in the way of ascertaining the nationality of any
given foreigner, and whether he has completed, or evaded,
the military training required by the laws of his country.
It may also be a question of high policy whether resident
enemies would not be a greater danger to this country if
they were compelled to remain here, than if they were
allowed, or compelled, to depart, possibly to return as
invaders.</p>

<p>I am only concerned to maintain that, as far as inter<span class="newpage"><a name="page047" id="page047">[047]</a></span>national
law is concerned, England has a free hand either
to expel resident enemies or to prevent them from leaving the
country, as may seem most conducive to her own safety.</p>

<p class="lettertitle"><a name="THE-NAVAL-PRIZE-BILL-CIVIL-DISABILITIES-OF-ENEMY-SUBJECTS" />THE NAVAL PRIZE BILL<br /><br />

CIVIL DISABILITIES OF ENEMY SUBJECTS</p>

<p>Sir,&mdash;The Naval Prize Bill has sins enough of its own
to answer for. The question dealt with under that heading
in Mr. Arthur Cohen's letter of this morning has, however,
nothing to do with naval matters, but arises under The
Hague Convention of 1907 as to warfare on land, which was
ratified by our Government two years ago; unfortunately
without any reserve as to the extraordinary provision
contained in Art. 28 (<i>h</i>) of that Convention.</p>

<p>I lose not a moment in asking to be allowed to state
that my view of the question is, and always has been, the
reverse of that attributed to me by my friend Mr. Cohen.
No less than three views are entertained as to the meaning
of Art. 28 (<i>h</i>). (1) Continental writers, <i>e.g.</i>, MM. Fauchille,
Kohler, and Ullmann, with the German Whitebook, assert,
in the most unqualified manner, that Great Britain and
the United States have under this clause abandoned their
long-established doctrine as to the suspension of the private
rights and remedies of enemy subjects; (2) Our own
Government, in a non-confidential reply to an inquiry
from Professor Oppenheim, asserts categorically, as does
General Davis in the United States, that the clause relates
only to the action of a commander in a territory of which
he is in occupation; while (3) most English and American
writers look upon the meaning of the clause as doubtful.
If Mr. Cohen will look at p. 44 of my <i>Laws of War on Land</i>,<span class="newpage"><a name="page048" id="page048">[048]</a></span>
1909, he will find that I carry this sceptical attitude so
far as to include the clause in question in brackets as
&quot;apocryphal,&quot; with the comment that &quot;it can hardly,
till its policy has been seriously discussed, be treated as a
rule of international law.&quot; I have accordingly maintained,
in correspondence with my Continental colleagues, that the
clause should be treated as &quot;non avenue,&quot; as &quot;un non
sens,&quot; on the ground that, while, torn from their context,
its words would seem (&quot;ont faux air&quot;) to bear the Continental
interpretation, its position as part of a &quot;R&egrave;glement,&quot;
in conformity with which the Powers are to &quot;issue
instructions to their armed land forces,&quot; conclusively
negatives this interpretation. I will not to-day trouble
you in detail with the very curious history of the clause;
which, as originally proposed by Germany, merely prohibited
(a commander?) from announcing that the private claims
(&quot;r&eacute;clamations&quot;) of enemy subjects would be unenforceable.
It is astonishing that no objection was raised by the
British or by the American delegates to the subsequent
transformation of this innocent clause into something very
different, first by the insertion of the words &quot;en justice,&quot;
and later by the substitution of &quot;droits et actions&quot; for
&quot;r&eacute;clamations.&quot; The quiescence of the delegates is the
more surprising, as, at the first meeting of the sub-committee,
General de Gundel, in the plainest language, foreshadowed
what was aimed at by the clause.</p>

<p>Art. 23 (<i>h</i>) is, I submit, incapable of rational interpretation
and should be so treated by the Powers. If interpreted
at all, its sense must be taken to be that which is
now, somewhat tardily, put upon it by our own Government.</p>

<p class="subsectionhead">Enemy Ships in Port</p>

<p class="lettertitle"><a name="ENEMY-SHIPS-IN-PORT" />ENEMY SHIPS IN PORT</p>

<p>Sir,&mdash;The action taken by the United States in seizing
German merchant ships lying in their ports will raise several
questions of interest. It is, however, important at once
to realise that, apart from anything which may be contained
in old treaties with Prussia, their hands are entirely free
in the matter. The indulgences so often granted: to such
ships during the last 60 years, notably by themselves in
the Spanish War of 1898, under endlessly varying conditions,
have been admittedly acts of grace, required by no established
rule of international law.</p>

<p>The United States are also unaffected by The Hague
Convention No. vi, to which they are not a party. It is
therefore superfluous to inquire what construction they
would have been bound to put upon the ambiguous language
of Section 1 of the Convention, which proclaims that &quot;when
a merchant ship of one of the belligerent Powers is, at the
commencement of hostilities, in an enemy port, <i>it is desirable</i>
that it should be allowed to depart freely,&quot; &amp;c. It might
perhaps be argued that our own Prize Court might well
have refrained from treating this section as if it were
obligatory, and have founded its decisions rather upon
international law, as supplemented by a non-obligatory
custom. Be this as it may, it would seem that the policy of
the United States has to some extent felt the influence of
Convention vi. in announcing that seizure will, provisionally,
only amount to requisitioning.</p>

<p class="chaptertitle">THE CONDUCT OF WARFARE</p>


<div class="intronotes"><p>The three following sections relate to the waters in which hostile
operations may take place. Section 1 probably calls for no explanatory
remark. With reference to Section 2, dealing with certain spaces of
water more or less closed to belligerent action, it may be desirable to
state that the letters as to the Suez Canal were written to obviate some
misconceptions as to the purport of the Convention of October 29, 1888,
and to maintain that it was not, at the time of writing, operative,
so far as Great Britain was concerned.</p>

<p>This state of things was, however, altered by the Anglo-French
Convention of April 8, 1804, which, concerned principally with the
settlement of the Egyptian and Newfoundland questions, provides,
in Art. 6, that &quot;In order to assure the free passage of the Suez Canal,
the Government of His Britannic Majesty declares that it adheres to
the stipulations of the Treaty concluded on the 29th October 1888; and
to their becoming operative. The free passage of the canal being thus
guaranteed, the execution of the last phrase of paragraph 1, and
that of paragraph 2 of the 8th article of this Treaty, will remain
suspended.&quot;</p>

<p>The last phrase of paragraph 1 of Art. 8 relates to annual meetings
of the agents of the signatory Powers.</p>

<p>Paragraph 2 of this Article relates to the presidency of a special
commissioner of the Ottoman Government over those meetings.</p>

<p>On the whole question see <i>Parl. Papers, Egypt</i>, No. 1 (1888),
<i>Commercial</i>, No. 2 (1889), and the present writer's
<i>Studies in International Law</i>, pp. 275-293. Note must, of course,
now be taken of the constitutional changes resulting from the war of 1914.</p>

<p>The provisions of the Treaty of 1888, with reference to the free
navigation of the Suez Canal, have, of course, acquired a new
importance from their adoption into the Hay-Pauncefote Treaty of
November 18, 1901, as to the Panama Canal, and from the divergent
views taken of their interpretation, as so adopted.<span class="newpage"><a name="page051" id="page051">[051]</a></span></p></div>

<p class="lettertitle"><a name="THE-FREEDOM-OF-THE-SEAS" />&quot;THE FREEDOM OF THE SEAS&quot;?</p>

<p>Sir,&mdash;Your remarks upon &quot;the wide and ambiguous
suggestions&quot; contained in the Pope's Peace Note are
especially apposite to his desire for &quot;the freedom of the
seas.&quot; It is regrettable that his Holiness does not explain
the meaning which he attaches to this phrase, in itself
unmeaning, so dear to the Germans. He is doubtless well
aware that the sea is already free enough, except to pirates,
in time of peace, and must be presumed to refer to time
of war, and specifically to propose the prohibition of any
such interference with neutral shipping as is now legalised
by the rules relating to visit and search, contraband and
blockade.</p>

<p>If this be indeed the Pope's meaning, his aspirations
are now less likely than ever to be realised. It is curious
to reflect that the proposal actually made by our own
Government at The Hague Conference of 1907, apparently
under the impression that Great Britain would be always
neutral, for protecting the carriage of contraband was most
fortunately defeated by the opposition of the other great
naval Powers, of which Germany was one.</p>

<p class="lettertitle"><a name="THE-SUEZ-CANAL" />THE SUEZ CANAL</p>

<p>Sir,&mdash;Your correspondent &quot;M.B.&quot; has done good service
by calling attention to the misleading nature of the often-repeated
<span class="newpage"><a name="page052" id="page052">[052]</a></span>statement that the Suez Canal has been &quot;neutralised&quot;
by the Convention of 1888. Perhaps you will allow
me more explicitly to show why, and how far, this
statement is misleading.</p>

<p>In the first place, this Convention is inoperative. It
is so in consequence of the following reservation made by
Lord Salisbury in the course of the negotiations which
resulted in the signature of the Convention:&mdash;</p>

<div class="letterquot"><p>&quot;Les D&eacute;l&eacute;gu&eacute;s de la Grande-Bretagne ... pensent qu'il est de leur
devoir de formuler une r&eacute;serve g&eacute;n&eacute;rale quant &agrave; l'application de ces
dispositions en tant qu'elles ne seraient pas compatibles avec l'&eacute;tat
transitoire et exceptionnel o&ugrave; se trouve actuellement l'Egypte, et qu'elles
pourraient entraver la libert&eacute; d'action de leur Gouvernement pendant
la p&eacute;riode de l'occupation de l'Egypte par les forces de sa Majest&eacute;
Britannique.&quot;</p></div>

<p>Being thus unaffected by the treaty, the canal retains
those characteristics which it possesses, under the common
law of nations, as a narrow strait, wholly within the territory
of one Power and connecting two open seas. The fact that
the strait is artificial may, I think, be dismissed from
consideration, for reasons stated by me in the <i>Fortnightly
Review</i> for July, 1883. The characteristics of such a strait
are unfortunately by no means well ascertained, but may
perhaps be summarised as follows. In time of peace, the
territorial Power is bound by modern usage to allow &quot;innocent
passage,&quot; under reasonable conditions as to tolls and
the like, not only to the merchant vessels, but also, probably,
to the ships of war, of all nations. In time of war, the
territorial Power, if belligerent, may of course carry on, and
is exposed to, hostilities in the strait as elsewhere, and the
entrances to the strait are liable to a blockade. Should
the territorial Power be neutral, the strait would be closed
to hostilities, though it would probably be open to the
&quot;innocent passage&quot; of belligerent ships of war.</p>

<p>It may be worth while to enquire how far this state of
things would be affected by the Convention of 1888, were
<span class="newpage"><a name="page053" id="page053">[053]</a></span>it to come into operation. The <i>status</i> of the canal in time
of peace would be substantially untouched, save by the
prohibition to the territorial Power to fortify its banks.
Even with reference to time of war, several of the articles
of the Convention merely reaffirm well-understood rules
applicable to all neutral waters&mdash;<i>e.g.</i> that no hostilities
may take place therein. The innovations proposed by the
Convention are mainly contained, as &quot;M.B.&quot; points out,
in the first article, which deals with the position of the canal
when the territorial Power is belligerent. In such a case,
subject to certain exceptions, with a view to the defence of
the country, the ships of that Power are neither to attack
nor to be attacked in the canal, or within three miles of its
ports of access, nor are the entrances of the canal to be
blockaded. This is &quot;neutralisation&quot; only in a limited and
vague sense of the term, the employment of which was
indeed carefully avoided not only in the Convention itself
but also in the diplomatic discussions which preceded it.</p>

<p class="lettertitle"><a name="THE-SUEZ-CANAL-B" />THE SUEZ CANAL</p>

<p>Sir,&mdash;Your correspondent &quot;M.B.,&quot; if he will allow
me to say so, supports this morning a good case by a bad
argument, which ought hardly to pass without remark.</p>

<p>It is impossible to accept his suggestion that the article
which he quotes from the Treaty of Paris can be taken as
containing &quot;an international official definition of neutralisation
as applied to waters.&quot; The article in question, after
declaring the Black Sea to be &quot;neutralis&eacute;e,&quot; no doubt goes
on to explain the sense in which this phrase is to be
understood, by laying down that the waters and ports of that
sea are perpetually closed to the ships of war of all nations.
It is, however, well known that such a state of things as is
described in the latter part of the article is so far from
<span class="newpage"><a name="page054" id="page054">[054]</a></span>being involved in the definition of &quot;neutralisation&quot; as
not even to be an ordinary accompaniment of that process.
Belgium is unquestionably &quot;neutralised,&quot; but no one
supposes that the appearance in its waters and ports of ships
of war is therefore prohibited. The fact is that the term
&quot;neutralis&eacute;e&quot; was employed in the Treaty of Paris as a
euphemism, intended to make less unpalatable to Russia
a restriction upon her sovereign rights which she took
the earliest opportunity of repudiating.</p>

<p class="lettertitle"><a name="THE-SUEZ-CANAL-C" />THE SUEZ CANAL</p>

<p>Sir,&mdash;Will you allow me to reply in the fewest possible
words to the questions very courteously addressed to me
by Mr. Gibson Bowles in his letter which appeared in
<i>The Times</i> of yesterday?</p>

<p>1. It is certainly my opinion, for what it is worth, that
the full operation of the Convention of 1888 is suspended
by the reserves first made on behalf of this country during
the sittings of the Conference of 1885. These reserves
were texually repeated by Lord Salisbury in his despatch
of October 21, 1887, enclosing the draft convention which,
three days later, was signed at Paris by the representatives
of France and Great Britain, the two Powers which, with
the assent of the rest, had been carrying on the resumed
negotiations with reference to the canal. Lord Salisbury's
language was also carefully brought to the notice of each of
the other Powers concerned; in the course of the somewhat
protracted discussions which preceded the final signature
of the same convention at Constantinople on October 29, 1888.</p>

<p>2. All the signatories of the convention having thus
become parties to it after express notice of &quot;the conditions
under which her Majesty's Government have expressed
<span class="newpage"><a name="page055" id="page055">[055]</a></span>their willingness to agree to it,&quot; must, it can hardly be
doubted, share the view that the convention is operative
only <i>sub modo</i>.</p>

<p>3. Supposing the convention to have become operative,
and supposing the territorial Power to be neutral in a war
between States which we may call A and B, the convention
would certainly entitle A to claim unmolested passage for
its ships of war on their way to attack the forces of B in the
Eastern seas.</p>

<p>4. The language of the convention, being as it, is the
expression of a compromise involving much re-drafting, is
by no means always as clear as it might be. But when
Mr. Gibson Bowles is again within reach of Blue-books he
will probably agree with me that the treaty need not, as he
suggests, be &quot;read as obliging the territorial Power, even
when itself a belligerent, to allow its enemy to use the
canal freely for the passage of that enemy's men-of-war.&quot;
The wide language of Art. 1 (which is substantially in
accordance with Mr. Gibson Bowles's reminiscence of it)
must be read in connection with Art. 10, and without forgetting
that, in discussing the effect of an attack upon the
canal by one of the parties to the convention, Lord
Salisbury wrote in 1887, &quot;on the whole it appears to be
the sounder view that, in such a case, the treaty, being
broken by one of its signatories, would lose its force in all
respects.&quot;</p>

<p class="lettertitle"><a name="THE-CLOSING-OF-THE-DARDANELLES" />THE CLOSING OF THE DARDANELLES</p>

<p>Sir,&mdash;Now that the pressure upon your space due to
the clash of opposing views of domestic politics is likely to
be for the moment relaxed, you may, perhaps, not think it
inopportune that attention should be recalled to a question
of permanent international interest raised by the recent
<span class="newpage"><a name="page056" id="page056">[056]</a></span>action of the Turkish Government in closing the Dardanelles
to even commercial traffic.</p>

<p>I cordially agree, as would, I suppose, most people,
with your leading article of some weeks since in deprecating
any crude application to the case of the Dardanelles and
Bosporus of <i>dicta</i> with reference to freedom of passage
through straits connecting two open seas. It would,
indeed, be straining what may be taken to be a general
principle of international law to say that Turkey is by
it prohibited from protecting her threatened capital by
temporarily closing the Straits.</p>

<p>A good deal of vague reference has, however, been made
in the discussions which have taken place upon the subject
to &quot;Treaties&quot; under which it seems to be thought that
trading ships enjoy, in all circumstances, rights of free
navigation through the Straits in question which they
would not have possessed otherwise. I should like,
therefore, with your permission, to state what seem to be
the relevant Treaty provisions upon the subject, whether
between the Powers constituting the European Concert
collectively, or between Russia and Turkey as individual
Powers.</p>

<p>As to what may be described as the &quot;European&quot; Treaties,
it is necessary, once for all, to put aside as irrelevant
Art. 10 of the Treaty of Paris of 1856 and its annexed
Convention; Art. 2 of the Treaty of London of 1871; and
the confirmatory Art. 63 of the Treaty of Berlin of 1878.
These articles have exclusive reference to the &quot;ancient
rule of the Ottoman Empire,&quot; under which, so long as the
Porte is at peace, no foreign ships of war are to be admitted
into the Straits. There are, however, two articles, still
in force, of these &quot;European&quot; Treaties which may seem to
bear upon the present inquiry. By Art. 12 of the Treaty
of Paris:&mdash;</p>

<div class="letterquot"><p>&quot;Free from any impediment, the commerce in the ports and waters of
the Black Sea shall be subject only to regulations of health, Customs,
<span class="newpage"><a name="page057" id="page057">[057]</a></span>and police, framed in a spirit favourable to the development of
commercial transactions.&quot;</p></div>

<p>And by Art. 3 of the Treaty of London:&mdash;</p>

<div class="letterquot"><p>&quot;The Black Sea remains open, as heretofore, to the mercantile
marine of all nations.&quot;</p></div>

<p>It is submitted that these provisions relate solely to
commerce carried on by vessels already within the Black Sea,
and contain no covenant for an unrestricted right of access
to that sea.</p>

<p>As between Russia and Turkey individually, Treaties
which are still in force purport, no doubt, to give to the
former a stronger claim to free passage through the Straits
for her mercantile marine than that which can be supposed
to be enjoyed by other Powers. By Art. 7, for instance,
of the Treaty of Adrianople of 1829, the Porte recognises
and declares the passage of the &quot;Canal de Constantinople,&quot;
and of the Strait of the Dardanelles, to be entirely free and
open to Russian merchant vessels; and goes on to extend
the same privilege to the merchant vessels of all Powers
at peace with Turkey. Art. 24 of the Treaty of San
Stefano is still more explicit, providing that &quot;the Bosporus
and Dardanelles shall remain open in time of war as in time
of peace to the merchant vessels of neutral States arriving
from or bound to Russian ports.&quot; The rest of the article
contains a promise by the Porte never henceforth to establish
a &quot;fictitious blockade, at variance with the spirit of the
Declaration of Paris&quot;; meaning thereby such a blockade
of ports on the Black Sea as had been enforced by Turkish
ships of war stationed at the entrance to the Bosporus.</p>

<p>It may well be doubted whether these articles, containing
concessions extorted from Turkey at the end of wars in
which she had been defeated, ought not, like so many other
provisions of the Treaty of San Stefano, to have been
abrogated by the Treaty of Berlin. They are of such a
character that, in the struggle for existence, Turkey can
hardly be blamed for disregarding them. As was said
<span class="newpage"><a name="page058" id="page058">[058]</a></span>long ago, &quot;Ius commerciorum aequum est, at hoc acquius,
tuendae salutis.&quot; The imperious necessities of
self-preservation were recognised both by Lord Morley and
by Lord Lansdowne in the debate which took place on May 3,
although Lord Lansdowne intimated that</p>

<div class="letterquot"><p>&quot;the real question, which will have to be considered sooner or later, is
the extent to which a belligerent Power, controlling narrow waters
which form a great trade avenue for the commerce of the world, is
justified in entirely closing such an avenue in order to facilitate the
hostile operations in which the Power finds itself involved.&quot;</p></div>

<p>It is, I think, clear that the solution of a question at once
so novel and so delicate must be undertaken, not by any
one Power, but by the Concert of Europe, or of the civilised
world, which must devise some guarantee for the safety
of any littoral Power which would be called upon in the
general interest to restrict its measures of self-defence. In
the meantime, we may surely say that the case is provided
for neither by established international law nor by
&quot;European&quot; Treaties; and, further, that the Treaties between
Russia and Turkey, which do provide for it, are not such
as it is desirable to perpetuate.</p>

<p>Sir,&mdash;I am reminded by Mr. Lucien Wolf's courteous
letter that I ought probably to have mentioned, in alluding
to the Treaty of San Stefano, that it is doubtful whether
Art. 24 of that Treaty is in force. It was certainly left
untouched by the Treaty of Berlin, but the language of
the relevant article (3) of the definitive Treaty of Peace
of 1879 is somewhat obscure, nor is much light to be gained
upon the point from the protocol of the 14th <i>s&eacute;ance</i> of the
Congress of Berlin, at which Art. 24 came up for discussion.</p>

<p>The earlier Treaties, however, which were revived beyond
<span class="newpage"><a name="page059" id="page059">[059]</a></span>question by Art. 10 of the Treaty of 1879, grant to Russian
merchant vessels full rights of passage between the Black
Sea and the &AElig;gean, exercisable, for all that appears, in
time of war as well as of peace, although these Treaties
contain no express words to that effect. Such rights, I
would again urge, if enjoyed by one Power, should be
enjoyed by all; upon terms to be settled, not by any pair
of Powers but by the Powers collectively.</p>

<p class="lettertitle"><a name="THE-GERMAN-THREAT" />THE GERMAN THREAT</p>

<p>Sir,&mdash;It may perhaps be desirable, for the benefit of
the general reader, to distinguish clearly between the two
topics dealt with in the recent announcement of German
naval policy.</p>

<p>1. We find in it what may, at first sight, suggest the
establishment of a gigantic &quot;paper blockade,&quot; such as
was proclaimed in the Berlin Decree of 1806, stating that
&quot;Les &icirc;les Britanniques sont d&eacute;clar&eacute;es en &eacute;tat de blocus.&quot;
But in the new decree the term &quot;blockade&quot; does not
occur, nor is there any indication of an intention to comply
with the prescriptions of the Declaration of Paris of 1856
as to the mode in which such an operation must be
conducted. What we really find in the announcement is the
specification of certain large spaces of water, including
the whole of the British Channel, within which German
ships will endeavour to perpetrate the atrocities about
to be mentioned.</p>

<p>2. These promised, and already perpetrated, atrocities
<span class="newpage"><a name="page060" id="page060">[060]</a></span>consist in the destruction of merchant shipping without
any of those decent preliminary steps, for the protection
of human life and neutral property, which are insisted
on by long established rules of international law. Under
these rules, the exercise of violence against a merchant
vessel is permissible, in the first instance, only in case of
her attempting by resistance or flight to frustrate the right
of visit which belongs to every belligerent cruiser. Should
she obey the cruiser's summons to stop, and allow its officers
to come on board, they will satisfy themselves, by examination
of her papers, and, if necessary, by further search,
of the nationality of ship and cargo, of the destination of
each, and of the character of the latter. They will then
decide whether or no they should make prize of the ship,
and in some cases may feel justified in sending a prize to
the bottom, instead of taking her into port. Before doing
so it is their bounden duty to preserve the ship papers, and,
what is far more important, to provide for the safety of all
on board.</p>

<p>This procedure seems to have been followed, more or
less, by the submarines which sank the <i>Durward</i> in the
North Sea, and several small vessels near the Mersey, but
is obviously possible to such craft only under very
exceptional circumstances. It was scandalously not followed
in the cases of the <i>Tokomaru</i>, the <i>Ikaria</i>, and the
hospital ship (!) <i>Asturias</i>, against which a submarine fired
torpedoes, off Havre, without warning or inquiry, and, of course,
regardless of the fate of those on board. The threat that
similar methods of attack will be systematically employed,
on a large scale, on and after the 18th inst., naturally
excites as much indignation among neutrals as among
the Allies of the Entente.</p>

<p class="subsectionhead">Aerial Warfare</p>

<div class="intronotes"><p>It may be desirable to supplement what is said in the following
letters by mentioning that the Declaration of 1899 (to remain in force
for five years) was largely ratified, though not by Great Britain; that of
1907 (to remain in force till the termination of the third Peace
Conference) was ratified by Great Britain and by most of the other great
Powers in 1909, not, however, by Germany or Austria; that aerial
navigation is regulated by the Acts, I &amp; 2 Geo. 5, c. 4, and 2 &amp; 3 Geo. 5,
c. 22; and that an agreement upon the subject was entered into
between France and Germany, on July 26, 1913, by exchange of notes,
&quot;en attendant la conclusion d'une convention sur cette mati&egrave;re entre
un plus grand nombre d'&eacute;tats&quot; (the international Conference held at
Paris in 1910 had failed to agree upon the terms of such a Convention);
and that Art. 25 of The Hague Convention of 1907, No. iv., was ratified
by Great Britain, and generally.</p></div>


<p class="lettertitle"><a name="THE-DEBATE-ON-AERONAUTICS" />THE DEBATE ON AERONAUTICS</p>

<p>Sir,&mdash;It is not to be wondered at that the Chairman
of Committees declined to allow yesterday's debate on
aviation to diverge into an enquiry whether the Powers
could be induced to prohibit, or limit, the dropping of
high explosives from aerial machines in war time. The
question is, however, one of great interest, and it may be
desirable, with a view to future discussions, to state precisely,
since little seems to be generally known upon the subject,
what has already been attempted in this direction.</p>

<p>In the <i>R&egrave;glement</i> annexed to The Hague Convention
of 1899, as to the &quot;Laws and Customs of War on Land,&quot;
Art. 23, which specifically prohibits certain &quot;means of
injuring the enemy,&quot; makes no mention of aerial methods;
but Art. 25, which prohibits &quot;the bombardment of towns,
villages, habitations, or buildings, which are not defended,&quot;
was strengthened, when the <i>R&egrave;glement</i> was reissued in
1907 as an annexe to the, as yet not generally ratified,
Hague Convention No. iv. of that year, by the insertion,
<span class="newpage"><a name="page062" id="page062">[062]</a></span>after the word &quot;bombardment,&quot; of the words &quot;by any
means whatever,&quot; with the expressed intention of including
in the prohibition the throwing of projectiles from balloons.</p>

<p>The Hague Convention No. ix. of 1907, also not yet
generally ratified, purports to close a long controversy, in
accordance with the view which you allowed me to advocate,
with reference to the naval manoeuvres of 1888, by
prohibiting the &quot;naval bombardment of ports, towns, villages,
habitations, or buildings, which are not defended.&quot; The
words &quot;by any means whatever&quot; have not been here inserted,
one would incline to think by inadvertence, having
regard to what passed in Committee, and to the recital
of the Convention, which sets out the propriety of extending
to naval bombardments the principles of the <i>R&egrave;glement</i>
(cited, perhaps again by inadvertence, as that of 1899) as
to the Laws and Customs of War on Land.</p>

<p>But the topic was first squarely dealt with by the first
of the three Hague Declarations of 1899, by which the
Powers agreed to prohibit, for five years, &quot;the throwing
of projectiles and explosives from balloons, or by other
analogous new methods.&quot; The Declaration was signed
and ratified by almost all the Powers concerned; not,
however, by Great Britain.</p>

<p>At The Hague Conference of 1907, when the Belgian
delegates proposed that this Declaration, which had expired
by efflux of time, should be renewed, some curious changes
of opinion were found to have occurred. Twenty-nine
Powers, of which Great Britain was one, voted for renewal,
but eight Powers, including Germany, Spain, France, and
Russia, were opposed to it, while seven Powers, one of
which was Japan, abstained from voting. The Japanese
delegation had previously intimated that, &quot;in view of the
absence of unanimity on the part of the great military
Powers, there seemed to be no great use in binding their
country as against certain Powers, while, as against the
rest, it would still be necessary to study and bring to perfection
<span class="newpage"><a name="page063" id="page063">[063]</a></span>this mode of making war.&quot; Although the Declaration,
as renewed, was allowed to figure in the &quot;Acte final&quot;
of the Conference of 1907, the dissent from it of several
Powers of the first importance must render its ratification
by the others highly improbable; nor would it seem worth
while to renew, for some time to come, a proposal which,
only two years ago, was so ill received.</p>

<p>I may perhaps add, with reference to what was said
by one of yesterday's speakers, that any provision on the
topic under discussion would be quite out of place in the
Geneva Convention, which deals, not with permissible
means of inflicting injury, but exclusively with the
treatment of those who are suffering from injuries inflicted.</p>

<p class="lettertitle"><a name="THE-AERIAL-NAVIGATION-ACT" />THE AERIAL NAVIGATION ACT<br /><br />
PRACTICAL DIFFICULTIES</p>

<p>Sir,&mdash;The haste with which Colonel Seely's Bill, authorising
resort to extreme measures for the prevention of
aerial trespass under suspicious circumstances, has been
passed through all its stages, was amply justified by the
urgent need for such legislation, which Russia seems to
have been the first to recognise. The task of those
responsible for framing regulations for the working of the
new Act will be no easy one. They will be brought face to
face with practical difficulties, such as led to the
adjournment of the Paris Conference of 1910.</p>

<p>In the meantime, it may interest your readers to have
some clue to what has taken place, with reference to the
more theoretical aspects of the questions involved, in so
competent and representative a body as the Institut de
Droit International. The Institut has had the topic
under consideration ever since 1900, more especially at
<span class="newpage"><a name="page064" id="page064">[064]</a></span>its sessions for the years 1902, 1906, 1910, and 1911. In
the volumes of its &quot;Annuaire&quot; for those years will be found
not only the text of the resolutions adopted on each occasion,
together with a summary account of the debates which
preceded their adoption, but also, fully set out, the material
which had been previously circulated for the information
of members, in the shape of reports and counter-reports
from inter-sessional committees, draft resolutions, and
such critical observations upon these documents as had
been received by the secretary. The special committee upon
the subject, of which M. Fauchille is <i>Rapporteur</i>, is still
sitting, and the topic will doubtless be further debated at
the session of the Institut, which will this year be held at
Oxford. No success has attended efforts to pass resolutions
in favour of any interference with the employment of
<i>a&eacute;ronefs</i> in time of war, such as was proposed by The
(now discredited) Hague Declaration, prohibiting the throwing
of projectiles and explosives from airships. With reference
to the use of these machines in time of peace, the debates
have all along revealed a fundamental divergence of opinion
between the majority of the Institut and a minority,
comprising those English members who have made known their
views. Both parties are agreed that aerial navigation
must submit to some restrictions, but the majority,
starting from the Roman law dictum, &quot;Naturali iure omnium
communia sunt <i>aer</i>, aqua profluens, et mare,&quot; would
always presume in favour of freedom of passage. The minority,
on the other hand, citing sometimes the old English saying,
&quot;Cuius est solum eius est usque ad coelum,&quot; hold that
the presumption must be in favour of sovereignty and
ownership as applicable to superimposed air space.</p>

<p>It is hardly necessary to observe that neither of the
maxims just mentioned was formulated with reference
to problems which have only presented themselves within
the last few years. The Romans, in the passage quoted,
were thinking not of aerial space, but of the element which
<span class="newpage"><a name="page065" id="page065">[065]</a></span>fills it. The old English lawyers were preoccupied with
questions as to projecting roofs and overhanging boughs
of trees. The problems now raised are admittedly incapable
of solution <i>a priori</i>, but the difference between the
two schools of thinkers is instructive, as bearing upon the
extent to which those who belong to one or the other school
would incline towards measures of precaution against
abuses of the novel art. This difference was well summed
up at one of our meetings by Professor Westlake as follows:
&quot;Conservation et passage, comment combiner ces deux
droits? Lequel des deux est la r&egrave;gle? Lequel l'exception?
Pour le Rapporteur (M. Fauchille) c'est le droit de passage
qui prime. Pour moi c'est le droit de conservation.&quot;</p>

<p class="lettertitle"><a name="SOVEREIGNTY-OVER-THE-AIR" />SOVEREIGNTY OVER THE AIR</p>

<p>Sir,&mdash;Mr. Arthur Cohen has done good service by
explaining that Great Britain has practically asserted the
right of a State to absolute control of the airspace
vertically above its territory. I may, however, perhaps be
permitted to remark that he seems to have been misinformed
when he states that the Institute of International
Law has arrived at no decision upon the subject. The
facts are as follows: The problems presented by the new
art of aerostation have been under the consideration of the
Institute since 1900, producing a large literature of reports,
counter-reports, observations, and draft rules, to debates
upon which no fewer than four sittings were devoted at
the Madrid meeting in 1911. Wide differences of opinion
then disclosed themselves as to territorial rights over the
air, the radical opposition being between those members
who, with M. Fauchille, the Reporter of the Committee,
would presume in favour of freedom of aerial navigation,
subject, as they would admit, to some measures of
<span class="newpage"><a name="page066" id="page066">[066]</a></span>territorial precaution, and those who, like the present
writer (&quot;il se proclame oppos&eacute; au principe de la libert&eacute; de
la navigation a&eacute;rienne, et <ins class="correction"
  title="Transcriber's note: Printed _s'entiendrait_ in original.">
s'en tiendrait</ins> plut&ocirc;t au principe
<i>cuius est solum, huius est usque ad coelum</i>, en y apportant
au besoin quelques restrictions,&quot; &quot;Annuaire,&quot; p. 821),
would subject all aerial access to the discretion of the
territorial Power.</p>

<p>The discussion took place upon certain <i>bases</i>, and No. 3
of these was ultimately adopted, though only by 21 against
10 votes, to the following effect: &quot;La circulation a&eacute;rienne
internationale est libre, sauf le droit pour les &eacute;tats
sous-jacents de prendre certaines mesures &agrave; d&eacute;terminer, en vue
de leur s&eacute;curit&eacute; et de celle des personnes et des biens de
leur territoire.&quot;</p>

<p>The Institut then proceeded to deal with <i>bases</i> relating
to a time of war, but was unable to make much progress
with them in the time available. The debate upon the
&quot;R&eacute;gime juridique des a&eacute;rostats&quot; was not resumed at
Christiania in 1911, nor is it likely to be at Oxford &quot;in the
autumn of the present year,&quot; as Mr. Cohen has been led to
suppose. Other arrangements were found to be necessary,
at a meeting which took place a week ago between myself
and the other members of our <i>bureau</i>.</p>

<p class="lettertitle"><a name="ATTACK-FROM-THE-AIR-THE-ENFORCEMENT-OF-INTERNATIONAL-LAW" />ATTACK FROM THE AIR<br /><br />
THE ENFORCEMENT OF INTERNATIONAL LAW</p>

<p>Sir,&mdash;In his interesting and important address at the
Royal United Service Institution, Colonel Jackson inquired:
&quot;Can any student of international law tell us definitely
that such a thing as aerial attack on London is outside
the rules; and, further, that there exists an authority by
which the rules can be enforced?&quot; As one of the students
<span class="newpage"><a name="page067" id="page067">[067]</a></span>to whom the Colonel appeals I should be glad to be allowed
to reply to the first of his questions.</p>

<p>The &quot;Geneva Convention&quot; mentioned in the address
has, of course, no bearing upon aerial dangers. The answer
to the question is contained in the, now generally ratified,
Hague Convention No. iv. of 1907. Art. 25 of the regulations
annexed to this Convention runs as follows:</p>

<div class="letterquot"><p>&quot;It is forbidden to attack or to bombard <i>by any means whatever
(par quelque moyen que ce soit)</i> towns, villages, habitations, or
buildings which are not defended.&quot;</p></div>

<p>It clearly appears from the &quot;Actes de la Conf&eacute;rence,&quot; <i>e.g.</i>
<i>T.</i> i., pp. 106, 109, that the words which I have italicised
were inserted in the article, deliberately and after
considerable discussion, in order to render illegal any attack
from the air upon undefended localities; among which I
conceive that London would unquestionably be included.</p>

<p>I cannot venture to ask the hospitality of your columns
for an adequate discussion of the gallant officer's second
question, as to the binding force attributable to
international law. Upon this I may, however, perhaps venture
to refer him to some brief remarks, addressed to you a
good many years ago, and now to be found at pp. 101 and
105 of the new edition of my &quot;Letters to <i>The Times</i> upon
War and Neutrality (1881-1918).&quot;</p>

<p class="lettertitle"><a name="ATTACK-FROM-THE-AIR-THE-RULES-OF-INTERNATIONAL-LAW" />ATTACK FROM THE AIR<br /><br />

THE RULES OF INTERNATIONAL LAW</p>

<p>Sir,&mdash;In reply to Colonel Jackson's inquiry as to any
rule of international law bearing upon aerial attack upon
London, I referred him to the, now generally accepted,
prohibition of the &quot;bombardment, <i>by any means whatever</i>,
of towns, &amp;c., which are not defended.&quot; This rule has
<span class="newpage"><a name="page068" id="page068">[068]</a></span>been growing into its present form ever since the Brussels
Conference of 1874. The words italicised were added to
it in 1907, to show that it applies to the action of <i>a&eacute;ronefs</i>
as well as to that of land batteries. It clearly prohibits
any wanton bombardment, undertaken with no distinctly
military object in view, and the prohibition is much more
sweeping, for reasons not far to seek, than that imposed
by Convention No. ix. of 1907 upon the treatment of coast
towns by hostile fleets.</p>

<p>So far good; but further questions arise, as to which
no diplomatically authoritative answers are as yet available;
and I, for one, am not wise above that which is
written. One asks, for instance, what places are <i>prima
facie</i> &quot;undefended.&quot; Can a &quot;great centre of population&quot;
claim this character, although it contains barracks, stores,
and bodies of troops? For the affirmative I can vouch
only the authority of the Institut de Droit International,
which in 1896, in the course of the discussion of a draft
prepared by General Den Beer Pourtugael and myself,
adopted a statement to that effect. A different view
seems to be taken in the German <i>Kriegsbrauch</i>, p. 22. One
also asks: Under what circumstances does a place, <i>prima
facie</i>, &quot;undefended,&quot; cease to possess that character?
Doubtless so soon as access to it is forcibly denied to the
land forces of the enemy; hardly, to borrow an illustration
from Colonel Jackson's letter of Thursday last, should the
place merely decline to submit to the dictation of two men
in an aeroplane.</p>

<p>I read with great pleasure the colonel's warning,
addressed to the United Service Institution, and am as
little desirous as he is that London should rely for protection
upon The Hague article, ambiguous as I have
confessed it to be; trusting, indeed, that our capital may
be enabled so to act at once in case of danger as wholly to
forfeit such claim as it may in ordinary times possess to
be considered an &quot;undefended&quot; town. Let the principle
<span class="newpage"><a name="page069" id="page069">[069]</a></span>involved in Art. 25 be carried into much further detail,
should that be found feasible, but, in the meantime, let us
not for a moment relax our preparation of vertical firing
guns and defensive aeroplanes.</p>

<p class="lettertitle"><a name="GERMANY-AND-THE-HAGUE" />GERMANY AND THE HAGUE</p>

<p>Sir,&mdash;One excuse for German atrocities put forward,
as you report, in the <i>Kolnische Zeitung</i>, ought probably
not to pass unnoticed, denying, as it does, any binding
authority to the restrictions imposed upon the conduct of
warfare, on land or at sea, by The Hague Conventions of
1907. It is true that each of these Conventions contains
an article to the effect that its provisions &quot;are applicable
only between the contracting Powers, and only if all the
belligerents are parties to the Convention.&quot; It is also true
that three of the belligerents in the world-war now raging&mdash;namely,
Serbia, Montenegro, and, recently, Turkey&mdash;although
they have (through their delegates) signed these
Conventions, have not yet ratified them. Therefore, urges
the <i>Zeitung</i>, the Conventions are, for present purposes,
waste paper. The argument is as technically correct as
<span class="newpage"><a name="page070" id="page070">[070]</a></span>its application would be unreasonable; and I should like
to recall the fact that, in the important prize case of the
<i>M&ouml;we</i>, Sir Samuel Evans, in a considered judgment, pointed
out the undesirability of refusing application to the maritime
conventions because they had not been ratified by
Montenegro, which has no navy, or by Serbia, which has
no seaboard; and accordingly, even after Turkey, which
also has not ratified, had become a belligerent, declined to
deprive a German shipowner of an indulgence to which he
was entitled under the Sixth Hague Convention.</p>

<p>Admiral von Tirpitz was perhaps not serious when he
intimated to the representative of the United Press of
America that German submarines might be instructed to
torpedo all trading vessels of the Allies which approach
the British coasts. The first duty of a ship of war which
proposes to sink an enemy vessel is admittedly, before so
doing, to provide for the safety of all its occupants, which
(except in certain rare eventualities) can only be secured
by their being taken on board of the warship. A submarine
has obviously no space to spare for such an addition to
its own staff.</p>

<p>Sir,&mdash;Would it not be desirable, in discussing the
execrable tactics of the German submarines, to abandon
the employment of the terms &quot;piracy&quot; and &quot;murder,&quot;
unless with a distinct understanding that they are used
merely as terms of abuse?</p>

<p>A ship is regarded by international law as &quot;piratical&quot;<span class="newpage"><a name="page071" id="page071">[071]</a></span>
only if, upon the high seas, she either attacks other vessels,
without being commissioned by any State so to do (<i>nullius
Principis auctoritate</i>, as Bynkershoek puts it), or wrongfully
displaces the authority of her own commander. The
essence of the offence is absence of authority, although
certain countries, for their own purposes, have, by treaty
or legislation, given a wider meaning to the term, <i>e.g.</i>, by
applying it to the slave-trade. &quot;Murder&quot; is such slaying
as is forbidden by the national law of the country which
takes cognizance of it.</p>

<p>In ordering the conduct of which we complain, Germany
commits an atrocious crime against humanity and public
law; but those who, being duly commissioned, carry out
her orders, are neither pirates nor murderers. The question
of the treatment appropriate to such persons, when they
fall into our hands, is a new one, needing careful consideration.
In any case, it is not for us to rival the barbarism
of their Government by allowing them to drown.</p>

<p class="lettertitle"><a name="SUBMARINE-CREWS" />SUBMARINE CREWS</p>

<p>Sir,&mdash;My letter in <i>The Times</i> of March 15 with reference
to the conduct of certain of the German submarines has
been followed by a good many other letters upon the same
subject. Some of your correspondents have travelled far
from the question at issue into the general question of
permissible reprisals, into which I have no intention of
following them. But others, by exhibiting what I may
venture to describe as an <i>ignoratio elenchi</i>, have made it
desirable to recall attention to the specific purport of my
former letter. It was to the effect&mdash;(1) that the acts of
those who, in pursuance of a Government commission, sink
merchant vessels without warning are not &quot;piracy,&quot; the
essence of that offence at international law being that it
<span class="newpage"><a name="page072" id="page072">[072]</a></span>is committed under no recognised authority; and that
neither is it &quot;murder&quot; under English law; (2) that the
question of the treatment appropriate to the perpetrators
of such acts, even under the orders of their Government,
is a new one, needing careful consideration. I was, of
course, far from stating, as a general rule, that Government
authority exempts all who act under it from penal consequences.
The long-established treatment of spies is
sufficient proof to the contrary.</p>

<p class="lettertitle"><a name="MR-WILSONS-NOTE" />MR. WILSON'S NOTE</p>

<p>Sir,&mdash;I may perhaps be permitted to endorse every
word of the high praise bestowed in your leading article
of this morning upon the Note addressed to Germany by
the Government of the United States. The frequent
mentions which it contains of &quot;American ships,&quot; &quot;American
citizens,&quot; and the like, were, no doubt, natural and
necessary, as establishing the <i>locus standi</i> of that Government
in the controversy which it is carrying on. But we
find also in the Note matters of even more transcendent
interest, relating to the hitherto universally accepted
doctrines of international law, applicable to the treatment
of enemy as well as of neutral vessels.</p>

<p>It may suffice to cite the paragraph which assumes as
indisputable</p>

<div class="letterquot"><p>&quot;the rule that the lives of non-combatants, whether they be of neutral
citizenship or citizens of one of the nations at war, cannot lawfully or
rightfully be put in jeopardy by the capture or destruction of unarmed
merchantmen,&quot;</p></div>

<p>as also</p>

<div class="letterquot"><p>&quot;the obligation to take the usual precaution of visit and search to
ascertain whether a suspected merchantman is in fact of belligerent
nationality, or is in fact carrying contraband under a neutral flag.&quot;<span class="newpage"><a name="page073" id="page073">[073]</a></span></p></div>

<p>[I assume that the word &quot;unarmed&quot; here does not
exclude the case of a vessel carrying arms solely for
defence.]</p>

<p>The Note also recognises, what you some time ago
allowed me to point out,</p>

<div class="letterquot"><p>&quot;the practical impossibility of employing submarines in the destruction
of commerce without disregarding those rules of fairness, reason, justice,
and humanity which modern opinion regards as imperative.&quot;</p></div>

<p>Adding:&mdash;</p>

<div class="letterquot"><p>&quot;It is practically impossible for them to make a prize of her, and
if they cannot put a prize crew on board, they cannot sink her without
leaving her crew and all on board her to the mercy of the sea in her
small boats.&quot;</p></div>

<p>Nothing could be more satisfactory than the views
thus authoritatively put forth, first as to the applicable
law, and secondly as to the means by which its prescriptions
can be carried out.</p>

<p class="lettertitle"><a name="GUERILLA-WARFARE" />GUERILLA WARFARE</p>

<p>Sir,&mdash;When Mr. Balfour last night quoted certain
articles of the &quot;Instructions for the Government of Armies
of the United States in the Field&quot; with reference to guerilla
warfare, some observations were made, and questions
put, upon which you will perhaps allow me to say a
word or two.</p>

<p>1. Mr. Healy seemed to think that something turned
<span class="newpage"><a name="page074" id="page074">[074]</a></span>upon the date (May, 1898) at which these articles were
promulgated. In point of fact they were a mere reissue of
articles drawn by the well-known jurist Francis Lieber,
and, after revision by a military board, issued in April,
1868 by President Lincoln.</p>

<p>2. To Mr. Morley's enquiry, &quot;Have we no rules of our
own?&quot; the answer must be in the negative. The traditional
policy of our War Office has been to &quot;trust to the
good sense of the British officer.&quot; This policy, though
surprisingly justified by results, is so opposed to modern
practice and opinion that, as far back as 1878-80, I
endeavoured, without success, to induce the Office to issue
to the Army some authoritative, though simple, body of
instructions such as have been issued on the Continent of
Europe and in America. The War Office was, however,
content to include in its &quot;Manual of Military Law,&quot; published
in 1888, a chapter which is avowedly unauthoritative,
and expressly stated to contain only &quot;the opinions of the
compiler, as drawn from the authorities cited.&quot;</p>

<p>3. The answer to Sir William Harcourt's unanswered
question, &quot;Were there no rules settled at the Hague?&quot;
must be as follows. The Hague Convention of 1899, upon
&quot;the laws and customs of warfare,&quot; ratified by this country
on September 4 last, binds the contracting parties to give
to their respective armies instructions in conformity with
the <i>R&egrave;glement</i> annexed to the Convention. This <i>R&egrave;glement</i>,
which is substantially a reproduction of the unratified
<i>projet</i> of the Brussels Conference of 1874, does deal, in
Arts. 1-3, with guerilla warfare. It is no doubt highly
desirable that, as soon as may be, the drafting of rules in
accordance with the <i>R&egrave;glement</i> should be seriously taken in
hand, our Government having now abandoned its <i>non
possumus</i> attitude in the matter. It will, however, be found
to be the case, as was pointed out by Mr. Balfour, that the
sharp distinction between combatants and non-combatants
contemplated by the ordinary laws of war is inapplicable<span class="newpage"><a name="page075" id="page075">[075]</a></span>
(without the exercise of undue severity) to operations such
as those now being carried out in South Africa.</p>

</div>

<div class="postnotes"><p>&quot;Lieber's Instructions,&quot; issued in 1863 and reissued in 1898, will
doubtless be superseded, or modified, in consequence of the United
States having, on April 9, 1902, ratified the Convention of 1899, and
on March 10, 1908, that of 1907, as to the Laws and Customs of War
on Land.</p>

<p>The answer to Mr. Morley's enquiry in 1900 would not now be in the
negative. The present writer's representations resulted in Mr. Brodrick,
when Secretary for War, commissioning him to prepare a Handbook of
the <i>Laws and Customs of War on Land</i>, which was issued to the Army
by authority in 1904. On the instructions issued by other National
Governments, see the author's <i>Laws of War on Land</i>, 1908, pp. 71-73.</p>

<p>The answer, given in the letter, to Sir William Harcourt's question
must now be supplemented by a reference to the Handbook above
mentioned as having contained rules founded upon the <i>R&egrave;glement</i>
annexed to the Convention of 1899, and by a statement that that
Convention, with its <i>R&egrave;glement</i>, is now superseded by Conventions
No. iv. (with its <i>R&egrave;glement</i>) and No. v. of 1907, of which account has
been taken in a new Handbook upon <i>Land Warfare</i>, issued by the War
Office in 1913.</p>

<p>As to what is required from a lawful belligerent, see Arts. 1 and 2
of the <i>R&egrave;glement</i> of 1899, practically repeated in that of 1907. The
substance of Art. 1 is set out in the letter which follows.</p>

<p>Art. 2 grants some indulgence to &quot;the population of a territory
which has not been occupied who, on the approach of the enemy,
spontaneously take up arms to resist the invading troops, without
having had time to organise themselves in accordance with Art. 1.&quot;
<i>Cf. infra</i>, pp. <a href="#page076">76</a>, <a href="#page079">79</a>.</p></div>


<p class="lettertitle"><a name="THE-RUSSIAN-USE-OF-CHINESE-CLOTHING" />THE RUSSIAN USE OF CHINESE CLOTHING</p>

<p>Sir,&mdash;If Russian troops have actually attacked while
disguised in Chinese costume, they have certainly violated
the laws of war. It may, however, be worth while, to point
out that the case is not covered, as might be inferred from
the telegram forwarded to you from Tokio on Wednesday
last, by the text of Art. 23 (<i>f</i>) of the <i>R&egrave;glement</i> annexed to<span class="newpage"><a name="page076" id="page076">[076]</a></span>
The Hague Convention &quot;on the laws and customs of war
on land.&quot; This article merely prohibits &quot;making improper
use of the flag of truce, of the national flag or the military
distinguishing marks and the uniform of the enemy, as well
as of the distinguishing signs of the Geneva Convention.&quot;</p>

<p>Art. 1 of the <i>R&egrave;glement</i> is more nearly in point, insisting,
as it does, that even bodies not belonging to the regular
army, which, it is assumed, would be in uniform (except
in the case of a hasty rising to resist invasion), shall, in order
to be treated as &quot;lawful belligerents,&quot; satisfy the following
requirements, <i>viz.</i>:&mdash;</p>

<div class="letterquot"><p>&quot;(1) That of being commanded by a person responsible for his
subordinates;</p>

<p>&quot;(2) That of having a distinctive mark, recognisable at a distance;</p>

<p>&quot;(3) That of carrying their arms openly; and</p>

<p>&quot;(4) That of conducting their operations in accordance with the
laws and customs of war.&quot;</p></div>

<p>The fact that, in special circumstances, as in the Boer
war, marks in the nature of uniform have not been insisted
upon, has, of course, no bearing upon the complaint now
made by the Japanese Government.</p>

<p>All signatories of The Hague Convention are bound
to issue to their troops instructions in conformity with
the <i>R&egrave;glement</i> annexed to it. The only countries which,
so far as I am aware, have as yet fulfilled their obligations
in this respect are Italy, which has circulated the French
text of the <i>R&egrave;glement</i> without comment; Russia, which has
prepared a little pamphlet of sixteen pages for the use of its
armies in the Far East; and Great Britain, which has issued
a Handbook, containing explanatory and supplementary
matter, besides the text of the relevant diplomatic Acts.</p>

<p class="lettertitle"><a name="THE-RIGHTS-OF-ARMED-CIVILIANS" />THE RIGHTS OF ARMED CIVILIANS</p>

<p>Sir,&mdash;It is interesting to be reminded by Sir Edward
Ridley of the view taken by Sir Walter Scott of the right
and duty of civilians to defend themselves against an
invading enemy. International law is, however, made
neither by the ruling of an &quot;impartial historian,&quot; on the
one hand, nor by the <i>ipse dixit</i> of an Emperor, on the other.</p>

<p>In point of fact, the question raised by Sir Edward is
not an open one, and, even in our own favoured country,
it is most desirable that every one should know exactly
how matters stand. The universally accepted rules as to
the persons who alone can claim to act with impunity as
belligerents are set forth in that well-known &quot;scrap of
paper&quot; The Hague Convention No. iv. of 1907; to the
effect that members of &quot;an army&quot; (in which term militia
and bodies of volunteers are included) must (1) be responsibly
commanded, (2) bear distinctive marks, visible at a distance,
(3) carry their arms openly, and (4) conform to the laws of
war. By way of concession, inhabitants of a district not
yet &quot;occupied&quot; who spontaneously rise to resist invasion,
without having had time to become organised, will be
privileged if they conform to requirements (3) and (4).
These rules are practically a republication of those of The
Hague Convention of 1899, which again were founded upon
the recommendations of the Brussels Conference of 1874,
although, at the Conference, Baron Lambermont regretted
that &quot;si les citoyens doivent &ecirc;tre conduits au supplice pour
avoir tent&eacute; de d&eacute;fendre leur pays, au p&eacute;ril de leur vie, ils
trouvent inscrit, sur le poteau au pied duquel ils seront
fusill&eacute;s, l'article d'un Trait&eacute; sign&eacute; par leur propre gouvernement
qui d'avance les condamnait &agrave; mort.&quot;</p>

<p><i>An Englishman's Home</i> was a play accurately representing
the accepted practice, shocking as it must be. I
remember the strength of an epithet which was launched
from the gallery at the German officer on his ordering the
<span class="newpage"><a name="page078" id="page078">[078]</a></span>shooting of the offending householder. It may be hardly
necessary to add that nothing in international usage justifies
execution of innocent wives and children.</p>

THE RIGHT TO TAKE UP ARMS</p>

<p>Sir,&mdash;I have read with some surprise so much of Sir
Ronald Ross's letter of to-day as states that &quot;the issue
still remains dark&quot; as to the right of civilians to bear arms
in case of invasion. It has long been settled that non-molestation
of civilians by an invader is only possible upon
the understanding that they abstain from acts of violence
against him. Modern written international law has defined,
with increasing liberality, by the draft Declaration of 1874
and the Conventions of 1899 and 1907, the persons who
will be treated as lawful belligerents. Art. 1 of The Hague
Regulations of 1907 recognises as such, not only the regular
army, but also militia and volunteers. Art. 2 grants
indulgence to a <i>lev&eacute;e en masse</i> of &quot;la population&quot; (officially
mistranslated &quot;the inhabitants&quot;) of a territory not yet
occupied. Art. 3, also cited by Sir Ronald, has no bearing
upon the question.</p>

<p>The rules are, I submit, as clear as they could well be
made, and are decisive against the legality of resistance by
individual civilians, the sad, but inevitable consequence of
which was, as I pointed out in <i>The Times</i> of September 19
last, truthfully represented on the stage in <i>An Englishman's
Home</i>.</p>

<p>In the same letter I wrote that &quot;even in our own favoured
country it is most desirable that every one should know
<span class="newpage"><a name="page079" id="page079">[079]</a></span>exactly how matters stand.&quot; There are, however, obvious
objections, possibly not insuperable, to this result being
brought about, as is proposed by Sir Ronald Ross, by
Government action.</p>

<p class="lettertitle"><a name="CIVILIANS-AND-A-RAID" />CIVILIANS AND A RAID</p>

<p>Sir,&mdash;It is satisfactory to learn, from Mr. McKenna's
answer to a question last night, that the duty of the civilian
population, at any rate in certain counties, is engaging the
attention of Government. I confess, however, to having
read with surprise Mr. Tennant's announcement that &quot;it
was provided by The Hague Convention that the wearing
of a brassard ensured that the wearer would be regarded
as a belligerent.&quot; It ought surely to be now generally
known that, among the four conditions imposed by the
Convention upon Militia and bodies of Volunteers, in order
to their being treated as belligerents, the third is &quot;that
they shall bear a distinctive mark, fixed and recognisable
at a distance.&quot; Whether an enemy would accept the mere
wearing of a brassard as fulfilling this condition is perhaps
an open question upon which some light may be thrown
by the controversies of 1871 with reference to <i>francs-tireurs</i>.</p>

<p class="lettertitle"><a name="MISS-CAVELLS-CASE" />MISS CAVELL'S CASE</p>

<p>Sir,&mdash;The world-wide abhorrence of the execution of
Miss Cavell, aggravated as it was by the indecent and
stealthy haste with which it was carried out, is in no need
of enhancement by questionable arguments, such as, I
venture to say, are those addressed to you by Sir James
Swettenham.<span class="newpage"><a name="page080" id="page080">[080]</a></span></p>

<p>It is, of course, the case that Germany is in Belgium
only as the result of her deliberate violation of solemnly
contracted treaties, but she is in military &quot;occupation&quot;
of the territory. From such &quot;occupation&quot; it cannot be
disputed that there flow certain rights of self-defence.
No one, for instance, would have complained of her stern
repression of civilian attacks upon her troops, so long as
it was confined to actual offenders. The passages quoted
by Sir James from Hague Convention v., and from the
<i>Kriegsbrauch</i>, relate entirely to the rights and duties of
Governments, and have no bearing upon the tragical abuse
of jurisdiction which is occupying the minds of all of us.</p>

<p>May I take this opportunity of calling attention to the
fresh evidence afforded by the new Order in Council of
our good fortune in not being bound by the Declaration
of London, which erroneously professed to &quot;correspond
in substance with the generally recognised principles of
International Law&quot;? Is it too late, even now, to announce,
by a comprehensive Order in Council, any relaxations which
we and our Allies think proper to make of well-established
rules of Prize Law, without any reference to the more and
more discredited provisions of the Declaration, the partial
and provisional adoption of which seems, at the outbreak
of the war, to have been thought likely to save trouble?</p>

<p class="subsectionhead">Privateering</p>

<div class="intronotes"><p>The three letters which immediately follow were written to point
out that neither belligerent in the war of 1898 was under any obligation
not to employ privateers. Within, however, a few days after the date
of the second of these letters, both the United States and Spain, though
both still to be reckoned among the few powers which had not acceded
<span class="newpage"><a name="page081" id="page081">[081]</a></span>to the Declaration of Paris, announced their intention to conduct the
war in accordance with the rules laid down by the Declaration.</p>

<p>Art. 3 of the Spanish Royal Decree of April 23 was to the effect
that &quot;notwithstanding that Spain is not bound by the Declaration
signed in Paris on April 16, 1856, as she expressly stated her wish not
to adhere to it, my Government, guided by the principles of international
law, intends to observe, and hereby orders that the following regulations
for maritime law be observed,&quot; <i>viz.</i> Arts. 2, 3, and 4 of the Declaration,
after setting out which, the Decree proceeds to state that the Government,
while maintaining &quot;their right to issue letters of marque, ... will
organise, for the present, a service of auxiliary cruisers ... subject
to the statutes and jurisdiction of the Navy.&quot;</p>

<p>The Proclamation of the President of the United States of April 26
recited the desirability of the war being &quot;conducted upon principles
in harmony with the present views of nations, and sanctioned by
their recent practice,&quot; and that it &quot;has already been announced that
the policy of the Government will not be to resort to privateering,
but to adhere to the rules of the Declaration of Paris,&quot; and goes on to
adopt rules 2, 3, and 4 of the Declaration.</p>

<p>Ten years afterwards, <i>viz.</i> on January 18, 1908, Spain signified
&quot;her entire and definitive adhesion to the four clauses contained in
the Declaration,&quot; undertaking scrupulously to conduct herself accordingly.
Mexico followed suit on February 13, 1909. The United
States are therefore now the only important Power which has not
formally bound itself not to employ privateers. It seems unlikely
that privateers, in the old sense of the term, will be much heard of in
the future, though many questions may arise as to &quot;volunteer navies&quot;
and subsidised liners, such as those touched upon in the last section,
with reference to captures made by the <i>Malacca</i>; possibly also as to
ships &quot;converted&quot; on the High Seas.</p></div>


<p class="lettertitle"><a name="OUR-MERCANTILE-MARINE-IN-WAR-TIME-A" />OUR MERCANTILE MARINE IN WAR TIME</p>

<p>Sir,&mdash;There can be no doubt that serious loss would
be occasioned to British commerce by a war between the
United States and Spain in which either of those Powers
should exercise its right of employing privateers or of
confiscating enemy goods in neutral bottoms.</p>

<p>Before, however, adopting the measures recommended,
with a view to the prevention of this loss, by Sir George
Baden-Powell in your issue of this morning, it would be
desirable to enquire how far they would be in accordance
<span class="newpage"><a name="page082" id="page082">[082]</a></span>with international law, and what would be the net amount
of the relief which they would afford.</p>

<p>It is hardly necessary to say that non-compliance with
the provisions of the Declaration of Paris by a non-signatory
carries with it none of the consequences of a breach of the
law of nations. The framers of that somewhat hastily
conceived attempt to engraft a paper amendment upon
the slowly matured product of &oelig;cumenical opinion, far
from professing to make general law, expressly state that
the Declaration &quot;shall not be binding except upon those
Powers who have acceded, or shall accede, to it.&quot; As
regards Spain and the United States the Declaration is
<i>res inter alios acta</i>.</p>

<p>It follows that, in recommending that any action taken
by privateers against British vessels should be treated as
an act of piracy, Sir George Baden-Powell is advocating
an inadmissible atrocity, which derives no countenance
from the view theoretically maintained by the United
States, at the outset of the Civil War, of the illegality of
commissions granted by the Southern Confederation. His
recommendation that our ports should be &quot;closed&quot; to
privateers is not very intelligible. Privateers would, of
course, be placed under the restrictions which were imposed
in 1870, in accordance with Lord Granville's instructions,
even on the men-of-war of belligerents. They would be
forbidden to bring in prizes, to stay more than twenty-four
hours, to leave within twenty-four hours of the start of a
ship of the other belligerent, to take more coal than enough
to carry them to the nearest home port, and to take any
further supply of coal within three months. We might, no
doubt, carry discouragement of privateers by so much further
as to make refusal of coal absolute in their case, but hardly
so far as to deny entry to them under stress of weather.</p>

<p>The difficulties in the way of accepting Sir G. Baden-Powell's
other suggestion are of a different order. Although
we could not complain of the confiscation by either of the
<span class="newpage"><a name="page083" id="page083">[083]</a></span>supposed belligerents of enemy property found in British
vessels, as being a violation of international duty, we might,
at our own proper peril, announce that we should treat
such confiscation as &quot;an act of war.&quot; International law
has long abandoned the attempt to define a &quot;just cause of
war.&quot; That must be left to the appreciation of the nations
concerned. So to announce would be, in effect, to say:
&quot;Although by acting as you propose you would violate no
rule, yet the consequences would be so injurious to me that
I should throw my sword into the opposite scale.&quot; We
should be acting in the spirit of the &quot;Armed Neutralities&quot;
of 1780 and 1800. The expediency of so doing depends,
first, upon the extent to which the success of our action
would obviate the mischief against which it would be
directed; and, secondly, upon the likelihood that the
benefit which could be obtained only by imposing a new
rule of international law <i>in invitos</i> would counterbalance
the odium incurred by its imposition. On the former
question it may be worth while to remind the mercantile
community that, even under the Declaration of Paris,
neutral trade must inevitably be put to much inconvenience.
Any merchant vessel may be stopped with a view to the
verification of her national character, of which the flag is no
conclusive evidence. She is further liable to be visited and
searched on suspicion of being engaged in the carriage of
contraband, or of enemy military persons, or of despatches,
or in running a blockade. Should the commander of the
visiting cruiser &quot;have probable cause&quot; for suspecting
any of these things, though the vessel is in fact innocent
of them, he is justified in putting a prize crew on board
and sending her into port, with a view to the institution of
proceedings against her in a prize Court. A non-signatory
of the Declaration of Paris may investigate and penalise,
in addition to the above-mentioned list of offences, the
carriage of enemy goods. This is, no doubt, by far the
most important branch of the trade which is carried on
<span class="newpage"><a name="page084" id="page084">[084]</a></span>for belligerents by neutrals, but it must not be forgotten
that even were this branch of trade universally indulged,
in accordance with the Declaration of Paris neutral commerce
would still remain liable to infinite annoyance from
visit and search, with its possible sequel in a prize Court.</p>

<p>The question of the balance between benefit to be gained
and odium to be incurred by insisting upon freedom to carry
the goods of belligerents I leave to the politicians.</p>

<p class="lettertitle"><a name="OUR-MERCANTILE-MARINE-IN-WAR-TIME-B" />OUR MERCANTILE MARINE IN WAR TIME</p>

<p>Sir,&mdash;To-day's debate should throw some light upon
the views of the Government, both as to existing rules of
international law and as to the policy demanded by the
interests of British trade. It is, however, possible that
the Government may decline to anticipate the terms of the
Declaration of Neutrality which they may too probably
find themselves obliged to issue in the course of the next
few days, and it is not unlikely that the law officers may
decline to advise shipowners upon questions to which
authoritative replies can be given only with reference to
concrete cases by a prize Court.</p>

<p>You may perhaps, therefore, allow me in the meantime
to supplement my former letter by a few remarks, partly
suggested by what has since been written upon the subject.</p>

<p>It is really too clear for argument that privateers are
not, and cannot be treated as, pirates.</p>

<p>Sir George Baden-Powell still fails to see that the Declaration
of Paris was not a piece of legislation, but a contract,
producing no effect upon the rights and duties of nations
which were not parties to it. We did not thereby, as he
supposes, &quot;decline to recognise private vessels of war as
competent to use force on neutral merchantmen.&quot; We
merely bound ourselves not to use such vessels for such a
<span class="newpage"><a name="page085" id="page085">[085]</a></span>purpose. Sir George is still unable to discover for privateers
any other category than the &quot;<i>status</i> of pirate.&quot; He admits
that it would not be necessary for their benefit to resort to
&quot;the universal use of the fore-yard-arm.&quot; Let me assure
him that the bearer of a United States private commission
of war would run no risk even of being hanged at Newgate.
President Lincoln, it is true, at the outset of the Civil War,
threatened to treat as pirates vessels operating under the
&quot;pretended authority&quot; of the rebel States; but he was
speedily instructed by his own law Courts&mdash;<i>e.g.</i> in the
<i>Savannah</i> and in the <i>Golden Rocket</i> (insurance) cases&mdash;that
even such vessels were not pirates <i>iure gentium</i>. It is also
tolerably self-evident that we cannot absolutely &quot;close&quot;
our ports to any class of vessels. There is no inconsistency
here between my friend Sir Sherston Baker and myself.
We can discourage access, and of course, by refusal of coal,
render egress impossible for privateers. Mr. Coltman would
apparently be inclined to carry this policy so far that he
would disarm and intern even belligerent ships of war which
should visit our ports: a somewhat hazardous innovation,
one would think.</p>

<p>It is quite possible that the question of privateering may
not become a practical one during the approaching war.
Both parties may expressly renounce the practice, or they
may follow the example of Prussia in 1870, and Russia
at a later date, in commissioning fast liners under the command
of naval officers&mdash;a practice, by the by, which is not,
as Sir George seems to think, &quot;right in the teeth of the Declaration
of Paris.&quot; See Lord Granville's despatch in 1870.</p>

<p>On Sir George's proposals with reference to the carriage
of enemy goods, little more need be said, except to deprecate
arguments founded upon the metaphorical statement that
&quot;a vessel is part of the territory covered by her flag,&quot; a
statement which Lord Stowell found it necessary to meet
by the assertion that a ship is a &quot;mere movable.&quot; There
can be no possible doubt of the right, under international
<span class="newpage"><a name="page086" id="page086">[086]</a></span>law, of Spain and the United States to visit and search
neutral ships carrying enemy's goods, and to confiscate such
goods when found. They may also visit and search on
many other grounds, and the question (one of policy) is
whether, rather than permit this addition to the list, we
choose to take a step which would practically make us
belligerent. This question also, it may be hoped, will not
press for solution.</p>

<p>In any case, let me express my cordial concurrence with
your hope that, when hostilities are over, some really
universal and lasting agreement may be arrived at with
reference to the matters dealt with, as I venture to think
prematurely, by the Declaration of Paris. A reform of
maritime law to which the United States are not a party
is of little worth. That search for contraband of war can
ever be suppressed I do not believe, and fear that it may
be many years before divergent national interests can be
so far reconciled as to secure an agreement as to the list of
contraband articles. In the meantime this country is unfortunately
a party to that astonishing piece of draftsmanship,
the &quot;three rules&quot; of the Treaty of Washington, to
which less reference than might have been expected has
been made in recent discussions. The ambiguities of this
document, which have prevented it from ever being, as was
intended, brought to the notice of the other Powers, with a
view to their acceptance of it, are such that, its redrafting,
or, better still, its cancellation, should be the first care of
both contracting parties when the wished for congress shall
take place.</p>

<p>May I add that no serious student of international law
is likely either to overrate the authority which it most
beneficially exercises, or to conceive of it as an unalterable
body of theory.</p>

<p>Sir,&mdash;Let me assure Sir George Baden-Powell that if,
as he seems to think, I have been unsuccessful in grasping
the meaning of his very interesting letters, it has not been
from neglect to study them with the attention which is
due to anything which he may write. How privateering,
previously innocent, can have become piratical, <i>i.e.</i> an
offence, everywhere justiciable, against the Law of Nations,
if the Declaration of Paris was not in the nature of a piece
of legislation, I confess myself unable to understand; but
have no wish to repeat the remarks which you have already
allowed me to make upon the subject.</p>

<p>I shall, however, be glad at once to remove the impression
suggested by Sir George's letter of this morning, that
Art. 7 of the Spanish Decree of April 24 has any bearing
upon the legitimacy of privateering generally. The article
in question (following, by the by, the very questionable
precedent of a notification issued by Admiral Baudin,
during the war between France and Mexico in 1889) merely
threatens with punishment neutrals who may accept letters
of marque from a belligerent Government.</p>

<p class="lettertitle"><a name="THE-DECLARATION-OF-PARIS-1911" />THE DECLARATION OF PARIS</p>

<p>Sir,&mdash;There is really no question at issue between
your two correspondents Mr. Gibson Bowles and &quot;Anglo-Saxon&quot;
as to the attitude of the United States towards
the Declaration of Paris.</p>

<p>Mr. Bowles rightly maintains that the United States
has not acceded to the Declaration as a whole, or to its
second article, which exempts from capture enemy property
in neutral ships. He means, of course, that neither the
whole nor any part of that Declaration has been ratified
<span class="newpage"><a name="page088" id="page088">[088]</a></span>by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate.
The whole contains, indeed, an article on privateering,
to which, as it stands, the United States have always
objected, and no part of the Declaration can be accepted
separately.</p>

<p>&quot;Anglo-Saxon,&quot; on the other hand, is equally justified
in asserting that the &quot;officially-recorded policy&quot; of the
States, <i>i.e.</i> of the Executive, is in accordance with
Art. 2 of the Declaration. This policy has been consistently
followed for more than half a century. Its strongest
expression is perhaps to be found in the President's
Proclamation of April 26, 1898, in which, after reciting that
it being desirable that the war with Spain &quot;should be
conducted upon principles in harmony with the present
views of nations and sanctioned by their recent practice,
it has already been announced that the policy of the Government
will not be to resort to privateering, but to adhere
to the rules for the Declaration of Paris,&quot; he goes on to
&quot;declare and proclaim&quot; the three other articles of the
Declaration. The rule of Art. 2, as to exemption of enemy
goods in neutral ships, was embodied in Art. 19 of the
Naval War Code of 1900 (withdrawn in 1904, for reasons
not affecting the article in question), and reappears in
Art. 17, amended only by the addition of a few words
relating to &quot;hostile assistance&quot; in the draft Code which
the United States delegates to the Conferences of 1907
and 1908 were instructed to bring forward &quot;with the
suggested changes, and such further changes as may be
made necessary by other agreements reached at the Conference,
as a tentative formulation of the rules which should
be considered.&quot; (My quotation is from the instructions
as originally issued in English.) Such changes as have
been made in the Code are due to discussions which have
taken place between high naval and legal authorities at
the Naval War College. I do not know whether the annual
reports of these discussions, with which I am kindly supplied,
<span class="newpage"><a name="page089" id="page089">[089]</a></span>are generally accessible, but would refer, especially with
reference to the Declaration of Paris, to the volumes for
1904 and 1906.</p>

<p>It can hardly be necessary to add that no acts of the
Executive, such as the Proclamation of 1898, the order
putting in force the Code of 1900, or the instructions to
delegates in 1907 and 1909, amount to anything like a
ratification of the Declaration in the manner prescribed
by the Constitution of the United States.</p>

<p class="lettertitle"><a name="THE-DECLARATION-OF-PARIS-1914" />THE DECLARATION OF PARIS</p>

<p>Sir,&mdash;Mr. Gibson Bowles resuscitates this morning his
crusade against the Declaration of 1856. It is really
superfluous to argue in support of rules which have met with
general acceptance for nearly sixty years past, to all of
which Spain and Mexico, who were not originally parties
to the Declaration, announced their formal adhesion in
1907, while the United States, which for well-known reasons
declined to accede to the Declaration, described, in 1898,
all the articles except that dealing with privateering as
&quot;recognised rules of International Law.&quot;</p>

<p>It may, however, be worth while to point out why it
was that no provision was made for the ratification of the
Declaration of 1856, or for that of 1868 relating to the use
of explosive bullets. At those dates, when the first steps
were being taken towards the general adoption of written
rules for the conduct of warfare, it was, curiously enough,
supposed that agreement upon such rules might be
sufficiently recorded without the solemnity of a treaty.
This was, in my opinion, a mistake, which has been avoided
in more recent times, in which the written law of war has
been developed with such marvellous rapidity. Not only
<span class="newpage"><a name="page090" id="page090">[090]</a></span>have codes of such rules been promulgated in regular
&quot;Conventions,&quot; made in 1899, 1906, and 1907, but the so-called
&quot;Declarations,&quot; dealing with the same topic, of 1899, 1907,
and 1909 have been as fully equipped as were those
Conventions with provisions for ratification. The distinction
between a &quot;Convention&quot; and a &quot;Declaration&quot; is therefore
now one without a difference, and should no longer be
drawn. Nothing in the nature of rules for the conduct of
warfare can prevent their expression in Conventions, and
the reason which seems to have promoted the misdescription
of the work of the London Conference of 1908-9 as
a &quot;Declaration&quot;&mdash;<i>viz.</i> an imaginary difference between
rules for the application of accepted principles and wholly
new rules&mdash;is founded in error. Much of the contents of
The Hague &quot;Conventions&quot; is as old as the hills while much
of the &quot;Declaration&quot; of London is revolutionary.</p>

<p>This by the way. It is not very clear whether
Mr. Gibson Bowles, in exhorting us to denounce the Declaration,
relies upon its original lack of ratification, or upon
some alleged &quot;privateering&quot; on the part of the Germans.
Nothing of the kind has been reported. The commissioning
of warships on the high seas is a different thing, which
may possibly be regarded as an offence of a graver nature.
Great Britain is not going to imitate the cynical contempt
for treaties, evidenced by the action of Germany in Belgium
and Luxemburg, in disregard not only of the well-known
treaties of 1889 and 1867, but of a quite recent solemn
undertaking, to which I have not noticed any reference.
Art. 2 of The Hague Convention No. v. of 1907, ratified
by her in 1909, is to the following effect:&mdash;</p>

<div class="letterquot"><p>&quot;Belligerents are forbidden to move across the territory of a neutral
Power troops or convoys, whether of munitions or of supplies.&quot;</p></div>

<span class="newpage"><a name="page091" id="page091">[091]</a></span></div>

<p>The true ground for objecting to the legality of the
purchase by Turkey of the German warships which have
been forced to take refuge in her waters is no doubt that
stated by Sir William Scott in the <i>Minerva</i>, 6 C. Rob.
at p. 400&mdash;<i>viz.</i> that it would enable the belligerent to whom
the ships belong &quot;so far to rescue himself from the disadvantage
into which he has fallen as to have the value at
least restored to him by a neutral purchaser.&quot; The point
is not touched upon in the (draft) Declaration of London.</p>

<p>Even supposing the purchase to be unobjectionable,
the duty of Turkey to remove all belligerents from the
ships would be unquestionable.</p>

<p class="lettertitle"><a name="THE-DECLARATION-OF-PARIS-1916" />THE DECLARATION OF PARIS</p>

<p>Sir,&mdash;The resuscitation, a few days ago, in the House
of Commons of an old controversy reminds one of the
mistaken procedure which made such a controversy possible.
It can hardly now be doubted that the rules set forth in
the Declaration of Paris of 1856, except possibly the
prohibition of privateering, have by general acceptance during
sixty years, strengthened by express accessions on the part
of so many Governments, become a portion of international
law, and are thus binding upon Great Britain,
notwithstanding her omission to ratify the Declaration.
This omission is now seen to have been a mistake. So also
was the description of the document as a &quot;declaration.&quot;
Both mistakes were repeated in 1868 with reference to the
&quot;Declaration&quot; of St. Petersburg (as to explosive bullets).</p>

<p>In those early attempts at legislation for the conduct
of warfare it seems to have been thought sufficient that
the conclusions arrived at by authorised delegates should
be announced without being embodied in a treaty. Surely,
however, what purported to be international agreements
<span class="newpage"><a name="page092" id="page092">[092]</a></span>upon vastly important topics ought to have been
accompanied by all the formalities required for
&quot;conventions,&quot; and should have been so entitled. In later
times this has become the general rule for the increasingly
numerous agreements which bear upon the conduct of
hostilities. Thus we have The Hague &quot;conventions&quot; of
1899 and 1907, and the Geneva &quot;convention&quot; of 1906,
all duly equipped with provisions for ratification. Such
provisions are also inserted in certain other recent agreements
dealing with aerial bombardments, gases, and expanding
bullets, which it has nevertheless pleased their
contrivers to misdescribe as &quot;declarations.&quot; Equally so
misdescribed was the deceased Declaration of London,
with a view, apparently, to suggesting, as was far from
being the case, that it was a mere orderly statement of
universally accepted principles, creating no new obligations.</p>

<p>Is it not to be desired that all future attempts for the
international regulation of warfare should not only be
specifically made subject to ratification, but should also,
in accordance with fact, be described as &quot;conventions&quot;?</p>

<p>Sir,&mdash;If Mr. Gibson Bowles, whose courteous letter I
have just been reading, will look again at my letter of the
18th, I think he will see that I there carefully distinguished
between the Declaration of Paris, which, as is notorious,
must be accepted as a whole or not at all, and the rules
set forth in it, &quot;except, possibly, the prohibition of
privateering,&quot; which I thought, for the reasons which
I stated, might be taken to have become a portion of
International Law.</p>

<p>I must be excused from following Mr. Bowles into a
<span class="newpage"><a name="page093" id="page093">[093]</a></span>discussion of the bearing of those rules upon the Order in

<p>Sir,&mdash;It was reported a few days ago that the Natal
Government had offered a reward for Bambaata, dead or
alive. I have waited for a statement that no offer of the
kind had been made, or that it had been made by some
over-zealous official, whose act had been disavowed. No
such statement has appeared. On the contrary, we read that
&quot;the price placed upon the rebel's head has excited native
cupidity.&quot; It may therefore be desirable to point out
that what is alleged to have been done is opposed to the
customs of warfare, whether against foreign enemies or rebels.</p>

<p>By Art. 28 (<i>b</i>) of The Hague Regulations, &quot;it is
especially prohibited to kill or wound treacherously individuals
belonging to the hostile nation or army&quot;: words which,
one cannot doubt, would include not only assassination
of individuals, but also, by implication, any offer for an
individual &quot;dead or alive.&quot; The Regulations are, of course,
technically binding only between signatories of the convention
to which they are appended; but Art. 28 (<i>b</i>) is
merely an express enactment of a well-established rule of
the law of nations. A recent instance of its application
occurred, before the date of The Hague Convention, during
<span class="newpage"><a name="page094" id="page094">[094]</a></span>operations in the neighbourhood of Suakin. An offer by
the British Admiral of a reward for Osman Digna, dead

<p class="lettertitle"><a name="BULLETS-IN-SAVAGE-WARFARE" />BULLETS IN SAVAGE WARFARE</p>

<p>Sir,&mdash;The Somaliland debate was sufficient evidence
that The Hague Convention &quot;respecting the laws and
customs of war on land&quot; is far more talked about than read.
Colonel Cobbe had, it appears, complained of the defective
stopping power, as against the foes whom he was encountering,
of the Lee-Metford bullet. It is the old story
that wounds inflicted by this bullet cannot be relied on to
check the onrush of a hardy and fanatical savage, though
they may ultimately result in his death. Whereupon
arises, on the one hand, the demand for a more effective
projectile, and, on the other hand, the cry that the
proposed substitute is condemned by &quot;the universal consent
of Christendom&quot;; or, in particular, &quot;by the Convention
of The Hague,&quot; which, as was correctly stated by Mr. Lee,
prohibits only the use of arms which cause superfluous injury.</p>

<p>You print to-day two letters enforcing the view of the
inefficiency against savages of the ordinary service bullet.
Perhaps you will find space for a few words upon the question
whether the employment for this purpose of a severer
form of projectile, such as the Dum Dum bullet, would be
a contravention of the &quot;laws of war.&quot;</p>

<p>The law of the subject, as embodied in general international
<span class="newpage"><a name="page095" id="page095">[095]</a></span>national agreements, is to be found in four paragraphs;
to which, be it observed, nothing is added by the unwritten,
or customary, law of nations. Of these paragraphs, which
I shall set out textually, three affirm general principles,
while the fourth contains a specific prohibition. The
general provisions are as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="letterquot"><p>&quot;The progress of civilisation should have the effect of alleviating as
much as possible the calamities of war. The only legitimate object
which States should set before themselves during war is to weaken the
military forces of the enemy. For this purpose it is sufficient to disable
the greatest possible number of men. This object would be exceeded by
the employment of arms which would uselessly aggravate the sufferings
of disabled men or render their death inevitable. The employment
of such arms would, therefore, be contrary to the laws of humanity.&quot;
(St. Petersburg Declaration, 1868. Preamble.)</p>

<p>&quot;The right of belligerents to adopt means of injuring the enemy is
not unlimited.&quot; (Hague <i>R&egrave;glement</i>, Art. 22.)</p>

<p>&quot;Besides the prohibitions provided by special conventions [the
Declaration of St. Petersburg alone answers to this description] it is
in particular prohibited (<i>e</i>) to employ arms, projectiles, or
material of a nature to cause superfluous injury.&quot; (<i>Ib.</i> Art. 23.)</p></div>

<p>The only special prohibition is that contained in the
Declaration of St. Petersburg, by which the contracting
parties&mdash;</p>

<div class="letterquot"><p>&quot;Engage mutually to renounce, in case of war among themselves,
the employment by their military or naval forces of any projectile of a
weight below 400 grammes which is either explosive or charged with
fulminating or inflammable substances.&quot;</p></div>

<p>No one, so far as I am aware, has any wish to employ
a bullet weighing less than 14 oz. which is either explosive
or charged as above. So far, therefore, as the generally
accepted laws of warfare are concerned, the only question
as to the employment of Dum Dum or other expanding
bullets is whether they &quot;uselessly aggravate the sufferings
of disabled men, or render their death inevitable&quot;; in other
words, whether they are &quot;of a nature to cause superfluous
injury.&quot; It is, however, probable that people who glibly
talk of such bullets being &quot;prohibited by The Hague Convention&quot;
<span class="newpage"><a name="page096" id="page096">[096]</a></span>are hazily reminiscent, not of the <i>R&egrave;glement</i>
appended to that convention, but of a certain &quot;Declaration,&quot;
signed by the delegates of many of the Powers represented
at The Hague in 1899, to the effect that&mdash;</p>

<div class="letterquot"><p>&quot;The contracting Powers renounce the use of bullets which expand
or flatten easily in the human body, such as bullets with a hard casing,
which does not entirely cover the core, or is pierced with incisions.&quot;</p></div>

<p>To this declaration neither Great Britain nor the United
States are parties, and it is waste-paper, except for Powers
on whose behalf it has not only been signed, but has also
been subsequently ratified.</p>

<div class="postnotes"><p>The Declaration last mentioned (No. 3 of the first Peace Conference)
is now something more than waste paper, having been generally
ratified. Great Britain, on August 17, 1907, at the fourth plenary
sitting of the Second Peace Conference, announced her adhesion to it,
as also to the, also generally ratified, Declaration No. 2 of 1899, which
forbids the employment of projectiles constructed solely for the diffusion
suffocating or harmful gases.</p>

<p>The provisions of Arts. 22 and 23 (<i>e</i>) of the <i>R&egrave;glement</i> annexed to
The Hague Convention of 1899 &quot;concerning the Laws and Customs of
War on Land,&quot; as quoted in the letter, have been textually reproduced
in Arts. 22 and 23 (<i>e</i>) of the <i>R&egrave;glement</i> annexed to the Hague
Convention, No. iv. of 1907, on the same subject, ratified by Great Britain on
November 27, 1909.</p>

<p>The written agreements as to the choice of weapons may be taken
therefore to start from the general principles laid down in the preamble
to the Declaration of St. Petersburg (though held by some Powers to
err in the direction of liberality), and in Arts. 22 and 23 (<i>e</i>) of The
Hague <i>R&egrave;glements</i>. The specially prohibited means of destruction
are, by the Declaration of St. Petersburg, explosive bullets; by The
Hague <i>R&egrave;glements</i>, Art. 23 (<i>a</i>) poison or poisoned arms; by The
Hague Declarations of 1898, Nos. 2 and 3, &quot;projectiles the sole object
of which is the diffusion of asphyxiating or harmful gases,&quot; and &quot;bullets
which expand or flatten easily in the human body, such as bullets with
a hard casing, which does not entirely cover the core, or is pierced
with incisions.&quot; As to Declaration No. 1, <i>cf. supra</i>, p. <a href="#page022">22</a>. It must
be remarked that the Declarations of St. Petersburg and of The<span class="newpage"><a name="page097" id="page097">[097]</a></span>
Hague, unlike The Hague R&egrave;glements, apply to war at sea, as well as
on land.</p>

<p class="lettertitle"><a name="GASES" />GASES</p>

<p>Sir,&mdash;The weightily signed medical protest which you
publish this morning will be widely welcomed. The German
employment of poisonous gases for military purposes, which
the Allies were obliged, reluctantly, though necessarily,
to reciprocate, was, of course, prohibited by international
Acts to which Germany is a party. Not only does the
Declaration of 1899 specifically render unlawful &quot;the use
of projectiles the sole object of which is the diffusion of
asphyxiating or harmful gases,&quot; but the Hague Conventions
of 1899 and 1907 both forbid, in general terms, the
employment of &quot;(<i>a</i>) poison or poisoned arms,&quot; &quot;(<i>c</i>) arms,
projectiles, or material of a nature to cause superfluous
suffering.&quot; The United States, like the rest of the world,
are a party to the two Conventions, and would doubtless,
after the experiences of recent years, no longer hesitate, as
hitherto, to adhere to the Declaration of 1899; in accordance
with Admiral Mahan's view at that date, to the effect that
&quot;the effect of gas shells has yet to be ascertained,&quot; and, in
particular, &quot;whether they would be more, or less, merciful
than missiles now available.&quot;</p>

<p>The prohibition ought, no doubt, to be renewed and, if
possible, strengthened; but this is surely not, as your correspondents
suggest, work for the Peace Congress. The rules
for naval warfare set out in the Declaration of Paris of 1856
form no part of the Treaty of Paris of that year.</p>

<p>I venture to make a similar remark with reference to
any discussion by the Peace Congress of &quot;the freedom of the
seas,&quot; a topic unfortunately included by President Wilson
among his &quot;14 points.&quot; The peace delegates will be concerned
with questions of regroupings of territory, penalties,
<span class="newpage"><a name="page098" id="page098">[098]</a></span>and reparation. The rehabilitation and revision of international
law is a different business, and should be reserved
for a subsequent conference.</p>

<p class="subsectionhead">The Geneva Convention</p>

<div class="intronotes"><p>As far back as the year 1870, the Society for the Prevention of
Cruelty to Animals exerted itself to induce both sides in the great war
then commencing to make some special provision for relieving, or
terminating, the sufferings of horses wounded in battle.</p>

<p>In 1899 it made the same suggestion to the British War Office,
but the reply of the Secretary of State was to the effect that &quot;he is
informed that soldiers always shoot badly wounded horses after, or
during, a battle, whenever they are given time to do so, <i>i.e.</i> whenever
the operation does not involve risk to human life. He fears that no
more than this can be done unless and until some international convention
extends to those who care for wounded animals the same
protection for which the Geneva Convention provides in the case of
men; and he would suggest that you should turn your efforts in that
direction.&quot;</p>

<p>Thereupon, Mr. Lawrence Pike, on November 23, addressed to
<i>The Times</i> the letter which called forth the letter which follows.</p></div>


<p class="lettertitle"><a name="WOUNDED-HORSES-IN-WAR" />WOUNDED HORSES IN WAR</p>

<p>Sir,&mdash;Everyone must sympathise with the anxiety felt
by Mr. L.W. Pike to diminish the sufferings of horses upon
the field of battle. How far any systematic alleviation
of such sufferings may be compatible with the exigencies
of warfare must be left to the decision of military experts.
In the meantime it may be as well to assure Mr. Pike that
the Geneva Convention of 1864 has nothing to do with the
question, relating, as it does, exclusively to the relief of
human suffering. This is equally the case with the second
Geneva Convention, which Mr. Pike is right in supposing
never to have been ratified. He is also right in supposing
<span class="newpage"><a name="page099" id="page099">[099]</a></span>that &quot;the terms of the convention are capable of amendment
from time to time,&quot; but wrong in supposing that
they can be amended &quot;by the setting up of precedents.&quot;
The convention can be amended only by a new convention.</p>

<p>It is not the case that Art. 7 of the convention, which
merely confides to commanders-in-chief, under the instructions
of their respective Governments, &quot;les d&eacute;tails d'ex&eacute;cution
de la pr&eacute;sente convention,&quot; gives them any authority
to extend its scope beyond what is expressly stated to be
its object&mdash;<i>viz.</i> &quot;l'am&eacute;lioration du sort des militaires
bless&eacute;s dans les arm&eacute;es en campagne.&quot; While, however,
the Geneva Convention, does not contemplate the relief of
animal suffering, it certainly cannot be &quot;set up as a bar&quot;
to the provision of such relief. Commanders who may
see their way to neutralising persons engaged in the succour
or slaughter of wounded horses would be quite within their
powers in entering into temporary agreements for that
purpose.</p>

<p>I may add that the &quot;Convention concerning the laws
and customs of war on land,&quot; prepared by the recent conference
at The Hague, and signed on behalf of most Governments,
including our own, though not yet ratified, contains
a chapter &quot;Des malades et des bless&eacute;s,&quot; which merely states
that the obligations of belligerents on this point are governed
by the Convention of Geneva of 1864, with such modifications
as may be made in it. Among the aspirations (<i>v&oelig;ux</i>)
recorded in the &quot;Acte final&quot; of the conference, is one to
the effect that steps may be taken for the assembling of
a special conference, having for its object the revision of
the Geneva Convention. Should such a conference be
assembled Mr. Pike will have an opportunity of addressing
it upon the painfully interesting subject which he has
brought forward in your columns.</p>

<div class="postnotes"><p>The &quot;second Geneva Convention,&quot; above mentioned, was the
&quot;Projet d'Articles additionnels,&quot; signed on October 20, 1868, but
never ratified.</p>

<p>Art. 21 of the <i>R&egrave;glement</i> annexed to The Hague Convention of
1899 as to the &quot;Laws and Customs of War on Land,&quot; stating that
&quot;the obligations of belligerents, with reference to the care of the sick
and wounded, are governed by the Convention of Geneva of August 22,
1864, subject to alterations which may be made in it,&quot; is now represented
by Art. 21 of The Hague <i>R&egrave;glement</i> of 1907, which mentions
&quot;the Convention of Geneva,&quot; without mention of any date, or of
possible alterations. The Convention intended in this later <i>R&egrave;glement</i>
is, of course, that of 1906, for the numerous Powers which have already
ratified it, since for them it has superseded that of 1864. The British
ratification, of April 16, 1907, was subject to a reservation, the necessity
for which was intended to be removed by 1 &amp; 2 Geo. 5, c. 20, as to
which, see <i>supra</i>, p. <a href="#page037">37</a>. The later is somewhat wider in scope than
the earlier Convention, its recital referring to &quot;the sick,&quot; as well
as to the wounded, and its first article naming not only &quot;les militaires,&quot;
but also &quot;les autres personnes officiellement attach&eacute;es aux arm&eacute;es.&quot;</p>

<p>With a view to the expected meeting of the Conference by which
the Convention was signed in 1906, Mr. Pike and his friends again, in
1903, pressed upon the British Government their desire that the new
Convention should extend protection to persons engaged in relieving
the sufferings of wounded horses. The British delegates to the Conference,
however, who had already been appointed, and were holding
meetings in preparation for it, were not prepared to advise the insertion
of provisions for this purpose in the revised Convention of Geneva.</p>

<p>&quot;The principles of the Geneva Convention&quot; of 1864 were applied
to naval warfare by The Hague Convention No. iii. of 1899, and those
of the Geneva Convention of 1906 by The Hague Convention No. x.
of 1907 respectively. Both were ratified by Great Britain. Cf. <i>supra</i>,

<p class="subsectionhead">Enemy Property in Occupied Territory</p>

<div class="intronotes"><p>By Art. 55 of The Hague <i>R&egrave;glement</i> of 1899, which reproduces Art. 7
of the Brussels <i>Projet</i>, and is repeated as Art. 55 of the <i>R&egrave;glement</i> of
1907: &quot;The occupying State shall regard itself as being only administrator
and usufructuary of the public buildings, immoveable property,
forests and agricultural undertakings belonging to the hostile State
<span class="newpage"><a name="page101" id="page101">[101]</a></span>and situated in the hostile country. It must protect the substance
of these properties and administer them according to the rules of
usufruct.&quot;</p>

<p>The following letter touches incidentally upon the description of
the rights of an invader over certain kinds of State property in the
occupied territory as being those of a &quot;usufructuary.&quot;</p></div>


<p class="lettertitle"><a name="INTERNATIONAL-USUFRUCT" />INTERNATIONAL &quot;USUFRUCT&quot;</p>

<p>Sir,&mdash;The terminology of the law of nations has been
enriched by a new phrase. We are all getting accustomed
to &quot;spheres of influence.&quot; We have been meditating for
some time past upon the interpretation to be put upon &quot;a
lease of sovereign rights.&quot; But what is an international
&quot;usufruct&quot;? The word has, of course, a perfectly ascertained
sense in Roman law and its derivatives; but it has
been hitherto employed, during, perhaps two thousand years,
always as a term of private law&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> as descriptive of a
right enjoyed by one private individual or corporation over
the property of another. It is the &quot;ius utendi fruendi,
salva rerum substantia.&quot; The usufructuary of land not
merely has the use of it, but may cut its forests and work
its mines, so long as he does not destroy the character of
the place as he received it. His interest terminates with
his life, though it might also be granted to him for a shorter
period. If the grantee be a corporation, in order to protect
the outstanding right of the owner an artificial limit is
imposed upon the tenure&mdash;<i>e.g.</i> in Roman law 100 years, by
the French Code 30 years. For details it may suffice to
refer to the Institutes of Justinian, II. 4; the Digest, VII.
1; the Code Civil, sects. 573-636; the new German Civil
Code, sects. 1030-1089.</p>

<p>It remains to be seen how the conception of &quot;usufruct&quot;
is to be imported into the relations of sovereign States, and,
more especially, what are to be the relations of the usufructuary
to States other than the State under which he
holds. It is, of course, quite possible to adapt the terms
<span class="newpage"><a name="page102" id="page102">[102]</a></span>of Roman private law to international use. &quot;Dominium,&quot;
&quot;Possessio,&quot; &quot;Occupatio,&quot; have long been so adapted,
but it has yet to be proved that &quot;Usufructus&quot; is equally
malleable. I can recall no other use of the term in international
discussions than the somewhat rhetorical statement
that an invader should consider himself as merely the
&quot;usufructuary&quot; of the resources of the country which he
is invading; which is no more than to say that he should
use them &quot;en bon p&egrave;re de famille.&quot; It will be a very
different matter to put a strict legal construction upon the
grant of the &quot;usufruct&quot; of Port Arthur. By way of
homage to the conception of such a grant, as presumably
creating at the outside a life-interest, Russia seems to have
taken it, in the first instance, only for twenty-five years.
One may, however, be pardoned for sharing, with reference
to this transaction, the scruples which were felt at Rome
as to allowing the grant of a usufruct to a corporation&mdash;&quot;periculum
enim esse videbatur, ne perpetuus fieret.&quot;</p>

</div>

<p>P.S.&mdash;It would seem from M. Lehr's <i>&Eacute;l&eacute;ments du droit
civil Russe</i> that &quot;usufruct&quot; is almost unknown to the law
of Russia, though a restricted form of it figures in the code
of the Baltic provinces.</p>

<div class="letterquot"><p>It is certain that, apart from general conventions, international
law imposes no liability on an invader to pay for requisitioned property
or services, or to honour any receipts which he may have given for them.</p>

<p>The Hague Convention of 1899 made no change in this respect.
Arts. 51 and 52 of the <i>R&egrave;glement</i> annexed to the Convention direct, it
is true, that receipts should be given for contributions (&quot;un re&ccedil;u sera
d&eacute;livr&eacute; aux contribuables&quot;) also for requisitions in kind, if not paid for
(&quot;elles seront constat&eacute;es par des re&ccedil;us&quot;), but these receipts were to
be merely evidence that money or goods have been taken, and it was
left an open question, by whom, if at all, compensation was to be made
or the losses thus established.</p>

<p>The <i>R&egrave;glement</i> of 1907 is more liberal than that of 1899 with reference
<span class="newpage"><a name="page103" id="page103">[103]</a></span>to requisitioned property (though not with reference to contributions).
By the new Art. 52, &quot;supplies furnished in kind shall be paid for, so
far as possible, on the spot. If not, they shall be vouched for (<i>constat&eacute;es</i>)
by receipts, and payment of the sums due shall be made as soon
as may be.&quot; The Hague Convention mentioned in the following letter
is, of course, that of 1899.</p></div>


<p class="lettertitle"><a name="REQUISITIONS-IN-WARFARE" />REQUISITIONS IN WARFARE</p>

<p>Sir,&mdash;A few words of explanation may not be out of
place with reference to a topic touched upon last night in
the House of Commons&mdash;<i>viz.</i> the liability of the British
Government to pay for stock requisitioned during the late
war from private enemy owners. It should be clearly
understood that no such liability is imposed by international
law. The commander of invading forces may, for valid
reasons of his own, pay cash for any property which he
takes, and, if he does not do so, is nowadays expected to
give receipts for it. These receipts are, however, not in
the nature of evidence of a contract to pay for the goods.
They are intended merely to <i>constater</i> the fact that the goods
have been requisitioned, with a view to any indemnity
which may eventually be granted to the sufferers by their
own Government. What steps should be taken by a Government
towards indemnifying enemies who have subsequently
become its subjects, as is now happily the case in South
Africa, is a question not of international law, but of grace
and favour.</p>

<p>An article in the current number of the <i>Review of Reviews</i>,
to which my attention has just been called, contains some
extraordinary statements upon the topic under discussion.
The uninformed public is assured that &quot;we owe the Boers
payment in full for all the devastation which we have inflicted
upon their private property ... it is our plain
legal obligation, from the point of view of international
law, to pay it to the last farthing.&quot; Then The Hague Convention
is invoked as permitting interference with private
<span class="newpage"><a name="page104" id="page104">[104]</a></span>property &quot;only on condition that it is paid for in cash by
the conqueror, and, if that is not possible at the moment,
he must in every case give a receipt, which he must discharge
at the conclusion of hostilities.&quot; There is no such
provision as to honouring receipts in this much-misquoted
convention.</p>

<p class="lettertitle"><a name="PRIVATE-PROPERTY-AT-SEA" />PRIVATE PROPERTY AT SEA</p>

<p>Sir,&mdash;The letter which you print this morning from
Mr. Charles Stewart can hardly be taken as a serious
contribution to the discussion of a question which has
occupied for many years the attention of politicians, international
lawyers, shipowners, traders, and naval experts.
Mr. Stewart actually thinks that Lord Sydenham's argument
to the effect that &quot;the fear of the severe economic strain
which must result from the stoppage of a great commerce
is a factor which makes for peace&quot; may be fairly paraphrased
as advice to &quot;retain the practice because it is so
barbarous that it will sicken the enemy of warfare.&quot; He
goes on to say that this argument &quot;would apply equally
to the poisoning of wells and to the use of explosive bullets.&quot;</p>

<p>It may be worth while to contrast with the attitude of
a writer who seems unable to distinguish between economic
pressure and physical cruelty that taken up by a competent
body, the large majority of the members of which belong
to nations which, for various reasons, incline to the abolition
of the usage in question. The Institut de Droit International,
encouraged by the weight attached to its <i>Manual<span class="newpage"><a name="page105" id="page105">[105]</a></span>
of the Law of War on Land</i> by the first and second Peace
Conferences, has been, for some time past, working upon
a <i>Manual of the Laws of War at Sea</i>. At its Christiania
meeting in 1912 the Institut, while maintaining the
previously expressed opinion of a majority of its members
in favour of a change in the law, recognised that such a
change has not yet come to pass, and that, till it occurs,
regulations for the exercise of capture are indispensable,
and directed the committee charged with the topic to draft
rules presupposing the right of capture, and other rules
to be applied should the right be hereafter surrendered
(<i>Annuaire</i>, t. xxv., p. 602).</p>

<p>The committee accordingly prepared a draft, framed in
accordance with the existing practice, to the discussion of
which the Institut devoted the whole of its recent session
at Oxford, eventually giving its <i>imprimatur</i> to a Manual
of the law of maritime warfare, as between the belligerents,
in 116 articles. As opportunity serves, the committee will
prepare a second draft, proceeding upon the hypothesis
that the right of capturing private property at sea has been
surrendered, which, in its turn, will be debated, word for
word, by the Institut de Droit International.</p>

<p class="subsectionhead">Martial Law</p>

<div class="intronotes"><p>The first of the letters which follow has reference to the case of
two Boer prisoners who, having taken the oath of neutrality on the
British occupation of Pretoria, attempted to escape from the town.
Both were armed, and one of them fired upon and wounded a sentinel
who called upon them to stop. They were tried by court-martial,
condemned to death, and shot on June 11, 1901. The Hague Convention
quoted in the letter is that of 1899, but the same Art. 8 figures
in the Convention of 1907.<span class="newpage"><a name="page106" id="page106">[106]</a></span></p>

<p>The second and third of these letters relate to a question of English
public law, growing out of the exercise of martial law in British territory
in time of war. One Marais, accused of having contravened the
martial law regulations of May 1, 1901, was imprisoned in Cape Colony
by military authority, and the Supreme Court at the Cape held that
it had no authority to order his release. The Privy Council refused an
application for leave to appeal against this decision, saying that &quot;no
doubt has ever existed that, when war actually prevails, the ordinary
courts have no jurisdiction over the action of the military authorities&quot;;
adding that &quot;the framers of the Petition of Right knew well what
they meant when they made a condition of peace the ground of the
illegality of unconstitutional procedure&quot; (<i>Ex parte</i> D.F. Marais, [1902]
A.C. 109). Thereupon arose a discussion as to the extent of the prohibition
of the exercise of martial law contained in the Petition of
Right; and Mr. Edward Jenks, in letters to <i>The Times</i> of December 27,
1901, and January 4, 1902, maintained that the prohibition in question
was not confined to time of peace.</p>

<p>The last letter deals with the true character of a Proclamation of
Martial Law, and was suggested by the refusal of the Privy Council,
on April 2, 1906, to grant leave to appeal from sentences passed in
Natal by court-martial, in respect of acts committed on February 8,
1906, whereby retrospective effect had, it was alleged, been given to a
proclamation not issued till the day after the acts were committed,

<p class="lettertitle"><a name="THE-EXECUTIONS-AT-PRETORIA" />THE EXECUTIONS AT PRETORIA</p>

<p>Sir,&mdash;No doubt is possible that by international law, as
probably by every system of national law, all necessary
means, including shooting, may be employed to prevent the
escape of a prisoner of war. The question raised by the
recent occurrence at Pretoria is, however, a different one&mdash;<i>viz.</i>
What are the circumstances in connection with an
attempt to escape which justify execution after trial by
court-martial of the persons concerned in it? This question
may well be dealt with a part from the facts, as to which we
are as yet imperfectly informed, which have called for Mr.
Winston Churchill's letter. With the arguments of that
letter I in the main agree, but should not attach so much
importance as Mr. Churchill appears to do to a chapter of
<span class="newpage"><a name="page107" id="page107">[107]</a></span>the British <i>Manual of Military Law</i>, which, though included
in a Government publication, cannot be taken as official,
since it is expressly stated &quot;to have no official authority&quot;
and to &quot;express only the opinions of the compiler, as drawn
from the authorities cited.&quot;</p>

<p>I propose, without comment, to call attention to what
may be found upon this subject in conventional International

international lawyers.</p>

<p>I. The Hague &quot;Convention on the laws and customs of
war on land&quot; (ratified by twenty Powers) lays down:&mdash;</p>

<div class="letterquot"><p>&quot;ARTICLE 8.&mdash;Prisoners of war shall be subject to the laws, regulations,
and orders in force in the army of the State into whose hands
they have fallen. Any act of insubordination warrants the adoption
as regards them of such measures of severity as may be necessary.
Escaped prisoners, recaptured before they have succeeded in rejoining
their army, or before quitting the territory occupied by the army that
captured them, are liable to disciplinary punishment. Prisoners who
after succeeding in escaping are again taken prisoners are not liable to
any punishment for their previous flight.&quot;</p></div>

<p>The Hague Conference, in adopting this article, adopted
also, as an &quot;authentic interpretation&quot; of it, a statement
that the indulgence granted to escapes does not apply to
such as are accompanied by &quot;special circumstances,&quot; of
which the instances given are &quot;complot, r&eacute;bellion, &eacute;meute.&quot;</p>

<div class="letterquot"><p>&quot;ARTICLE 12.&mdash;Any prisoner of war who is liberated on parole and
recaptured bearing arms against the Government to which he had
pledged his honour, or against the allies of that Government, forfeits
his right to be treated as a prisoner of war, and can be put on his trial.&quot;</p></div>

<p>II. The United States Instructions:&mdash;</p>

<div class="letterquot"><p>&quot;ARTICLE 77.&mdash;A prisoner of war may be shot or otherwise killed
in his flight; but neither death nor any other punishment shall be
inflicted on him simply for his attempt.... If, however, a conspiracy
is discovered, the purpose of which is a united or general escape, the
conspirators may be rigorously punished even with death, &amp;c.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;ARTICLE 78.&mdash;If prisoners of war, having given no pledge nor
made any promise on their honour, forcibly or otherwise, escape, and

<p class="lettertitle"><a name="THE-PETITION-OF-RIGHT-1901" />THE PETITION OF RIGHT</p>

<p>Sir,&mdash;This is, I think, not a convenient time, nor perhaps
are your columns the place, for an exhaustive discussion of
the interpretation and application of the Petition of Right.
It may, however, be just worth while to make the following
remarks, for the comfort of any who may have been
disquieted by the letter addressed to you by my friend
Mr. Jenks:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. Although, as is common knowledge, the words &quot;in
time of peace,&quot; so familiar in the Mutiny Acts from the reign
of Queen Anne onwards, do not occur in the Petition, they
do occur, over and over again, in the arguments used in
the House of Commons by &quot;the framers of the Petition
of Right,&quot; to employ the phraseology of the judgment
recently delivered in the Privy Council by the Lord
Chancellor.<span class="newpage"><a name="page109" id="page109">[109]</a></span></p>

<p>2. The prohibition contained in the Petition, so far
from being &quot;absolute and unqualified,&quot; is perfectly specific.
It refers expressly to &quot;Commissions of like nature&quot; with
certain Commissions lately issued:&mdash;</p>

<div class="letterquot"><p>&quot;By which certain persons have been assigned and appointed
Commissioners, with power and authority to proceed within the land,
according to the justice of martial law, against such soldiers or mariners,
or other dissolute persons joining with them, as should commit any
murder, robbery, felony, mutiny, or other outrage or misdemeanour
whatsoever, and by such summary course and order as is agreeable to
martial law, and is used in armies in time of war, &amp;c.&quot;</p></div>

<p>The text of these Commissions, the revocation of which
is demanded by the Petition, is still extant.</p>

<p>3. The Petition neither affirms nor denies the legality of
martial law in time of war; although its advocates were
agreed that at such a time martial law would be applicable
to soldiers.</p>

<p>4. A war carried on at a distance from the English shore
as was the war with France in 1628, did not produce such
a state of things as was described by the advocates of the
Petition as &quot;a time of war.&quot; &quot;We have now no army in
the field, and it is no time of war,&quot; said Mason in the course
of the debates. &quot;If the Chancery and Courts of Westminster
be shut up, it is time of war, but if the Courts be
open, it is otherwise; yet, if war be in any part of the
Kingdom, that the Sheriff cannot execute the King's writ,
there is <i>tempus belli</i>,&quot; said Rolls.</p>

<p class="lettertitle"><a name="THE-PETITION-OF-RIGHT-1902" />THE PETITION OF RIGHT</p>

<p>Sir,&mdash;In a letter which you allowed me to address to
you a few days ago, I dealt with two perfectly distinct
topics.</p>

<p>In the first place I pointed out that the words occurring
in a recent judgment of the Privy Council, which were cited
<span class="newpage"><a name="page110" id="page110">[110]</a></span>by Mr. Jenks as a clear example of an assumption &quot;that
the Petition of Right, in prohibiting the exercise of martial
law, restricted its prohibition to time of peace,&quot; imply, as
I read them, no assumption as to the meaning of that document,
but merely contain an accurate statement of fact as
to the line of argument followed by the supporters of the
Petition in the House of Commons. Can Mr. Jenks really
suppose that in making this remark I was &quot;appealing from
the 'text of the Petition' to the debates in Parliament&quot;?</p>

<p>I then proceeded to deal very shortly with the Petition
itself, showing that while it neither condemns nor approves
of the application of martial law in time of war (see Lord
Blackburn's observations in R. <i>v.</i> Eyre), the prohibition
contained in its martial law clauses, so far from being &quot;absolute
and unqualified,&quot; relates exclusively to &quot;commissions
of like nature&quot; with certain commissions which had been
lately issued (at a time which admittedly, for the purposes
of this discussion, was not &quot;a time of war&quot;), the text of
which is still preserved, and the character of which is set
forth in the Petition itself, as having authorised proceedings
within the land, &quot;according to the justice of martial
law, against such soldiers or mariners,&quot; as also against
&quot;such other dissolute persons joining with them,&quot; &amp;c. The
description of these commissions, be it observed, is not
merely introduced into the Petition by way of recital, but
is incorporated by express reference into the enacting clause.</p>

<p>Thus much and no more I thought it desirable to say
upon these two topics by way of dissent from a letter of
Mr. Jenks upon the subject. In a second letter Mr. Jenks
rides off into fresh country. I do not propose to follow him
into the history of the conferences which took place in May,
1628, after the framing of the Petition of Right, except to
remark that what passed at these conferences is irrelevant
to the interpretation to be placed upon the Petition, and,
if relevant, would be opposed to Mr. Jenks's contention.
It is well known that the Lords pressed the Commons to
<span class="newpage"><a name="page111" id="page111">[111]</a></span>introduce various amendments into the Petition and to
add to it the famous reservation of the &quot;sovereign power&quot;
of the King. One of the proposed amendments referred,
as Mr. Jenks says, to martial law, forbidding its application
to &quot;any but soldiers and mariners,&quot; or &quot;in time of peace,
or when your Majesty's Army is not on foot.&quot; The
Commons' objection to this seems to have been that it was
both unnecessary and obscurely expressed. &quot;Their complaint
is against commissions in time of peace.&quot; &quot;It may
be a time of peace, and yet his Majesty's Army may be on
foot, and that martial law was not lawful here in England
in time of peace, when the Chancery and other Courts do
sit.&quot; &quot;They feared that this addition might extend martial
law to the trained bands, for the uncertainty thereof.&quot;
The objections of the Commons were, however, directed not
so much to the amendments in detail as to any tampering
with the text of the Petition. &quot;They would not alter any
part of the Petition&quot; (nor did they, except by expunging
two words alleged to be needlessly offensive), still less would
they consent to add to it the reservation as to the &quot;sovereign
power&quot; of the King.</p>

<p>The story of these abortive conferences, however interesting
historically, appears to me to have no bearing upon
the legality of martial law, and I have no intention of
returning to the subject.</p>

<p class="lettertitle"><a name="MARTIAL-LAW-IN-NATAL" />MARTIAL LAW IN NATAL</p>

<p>Sir,&mdash;It seems that in the application made yesterday
to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, on behalf
of Natal natives under sentence of death, much stress was
laid upon the argument that a proclamation of martial law
cannot have a retrospective application. You will, perhaps,
therefore allow me to remind your readers that, so far from
<span class="newpage"><a name="page112" id="page112">[112]</a></span>the date of the proclamation having any bearing upon the
merits of this painful case, the issue of any proclamation
of martial law, in a self-governing British colony, neither
increases nor diminishes the powers of the military or other
authorities to take such steps as they may think proper
for the safety of the country. If those steps were properly
taken they are covered by the common law; if they have
exceeded the necessities of the case they can be covered
only by an Act of Indemnity. The proclamation is issued
merely, from abundant caution, as a useful warning to those
whom it may concern.</p>

<p>This view, I venture to think, cannot now be seriously
controverted; and I am glad to find, on turning to Mr.
Clode's <i>Military and Martial Law</i> that the passage cited
in support of Mr. Jellicoe's contention as to a proclamation
having no retroactive application is merely to the effect that
this is so, if certain statements, made many years ago in a
debate upon the subject, are correct. As to their correctness,
or otherwise, Mr. Clode expresses no opinion.</p>

<p class="subsectionhead">The Naval Bombardment of Open Coast Towns</p>

<div class="intronotes"><p>The four letters which first follow were suggested by the British
Naval Man&oelig;uvres of 1888, during which operations were supposed
to be carried on, by the squadron playing the part of a hostile fleet,
which I ventured to assert to be in contravention of international law.
Many letters were written by naval men in a contrary sense, and the
report of a committee of admirals appointed to consider, among other
questions, &quot;the feasibility and expediency of cruisers making raids on
an enemy's coasts and unprotected towns for the purpose of levying
contributions,&quot; was to the effect that &quot;there can be no doubt about
the feasibility of such operations by a maritime enemy possessed of
sufficient power; and as to the expediency, there can be as little doubt
<span class="newpage"><a name="page113" id="page113">[113]</a></span>but that any Power at war with Great Britain will adopt every possible
means of weakening her enemy; and we know of no means more
efficacious for making an enemy feel the pinch of war than by thus
destroying his property and touching his pocket.&quot; (<i>Parl. Paper</i>,
1889 [c. 5632], pp. 4, 8.) The supposed hostile squadron had, it
seems, received express instructions &quot;to attack any port in Great
Britain.&quot; (See more fully in the writer's <i>Studies in International
Law</i>, 1898, p. 96.) The fifth letter was suggested by a Russian protest
against alleged Japanese action in 1904.</p>

<p>The subsequent history of this controversy, some account of which
will be found at the end of this section, has, it is submitted, established
the correctness of the views maintained in it.</p></div>


<p class="lettertitle"><a name="NAVAL-ATROCITIES" />NAVAL ATROCITIES</p>

<p>Sir,&mdash;I trust we may soon learn on authority whether
or no the enemies of this country are conducting naval
hostilities in accordance with the rules of civilised warfare.
I read with indignation that the <i>Spider</i> has destroyed
Greenock; that she announced her intention of &quot;blowing
down&quot; Ardrossan; that she has been &quot;shelling the fine
marine residences and watering-places in the Vale of Clyde.&quot;
Can this be true, and was there really any ground for expecting
that &quot;a bombardment of the outside coast of the
Isle of Wight&quot; would take place last night?</p>

<p class="lettertitle"><a name="THE-NAVAL-MANOEUVRES-A" />THE NAVAL MAN&OElig;UVRES</p>

<p>Sir,&mdash;In a letter which I addressed to you on the 7th
inst. I ventured to point out the discrepancy between the
proceedings of certain vessels belonging to Admiral Tryon's
fleet and the rules of civilised warfare. Your correspondent
on board Her Majesty's ship <i>Ajax</i> yesterday told us something
of the opinion of the fleet as to the bombardment
and ransoming of defenceless seaboard towns, going on to
predict that, in a war in which England should be engaged,
privateers would again be as plentiful as in the days of<span class="newpage"><a name="page114" id="page114">[114]</a></span>
Paul Jones, and assuring us that in such a war &quot;not the
slightest respect would be paid to old-fashioned treaties,
protocols, or other diplomatic documents.&quot; Captain James
appears, from his letter which you print to-day, to be of
the same opinion as the fleet, with reference both to
bombardments and to privateers; telling us also in plain
language that &quot;the talk about international law is all
nonsense.&quot;</p>

<p>Two questions are thus raised which seem worthy of
serious consideration. First, what are the rules of
international law with reference to the bombardment of open
towns from the sea (I leave out of consideration the better
understood topic of privateering)? Secondly, are future
wars likely to be conducted without regard to international
law?</p>

<p>1. I need hardly say that I do not, as Captain James
supposes, contend &quot;that unfortified towns will never be
bombarded or ransomed.&quot; International law has never
prohibited, though it has attempted to restrict, the
bombardment of such towns. Even in 1694 our Government
defended the destruction of Dieppe, Havre, and Calais
only as a measure of retaliation, and in subsequent naval
wars operations of this kind have been more and more
carefully limited, till in the Crimean war our cruisers were
careful to abstain from doing further damage than was
involved in the confiscation or destruction of stores of arms
and provisions. The principles involved were carefully
considered by the military delegates of all the States of
Europe at the Brussels Conference of 1874, and their
conclusions, which apply, I conceive, <i>mutatis mutandis</i>, to
operations conducted by naval forces against places on
land, are as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="letterquot"><p>&quot;ARTICLE 15.&mdash;Fortified places are alone liable to be besieged.
Towns, agglomerations of houses, or villages which are open or
undefended cannot be attacked or bombarded.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;ARTICLE 16.&mdash;But if a town, &amp;c., be defended, the commander of
<span class="newpage"><a name="page115" id="page115">[115]</a></span>the attacking forces should, before commencing a bombardment,
and except in the case of surprise, do all in his power to warn the
authorities.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;ARTICLE 40.&mdash;As private property should be respected, the enemy
will demand from parishes or the inhabitants only such payments
and services as are connected with the necessities of war generally
acknowledged, in proportion to the resources of the country.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;ARTICLE 41.&mdash;The enemy in levying contributions, whether as
equivalents for taxes or for payments which should be made in kind,
or as fines, will proceed, as far as possible, according to the rules of
the distribution and assessment of the taxes in force in the occupied
territory. Contributions can be imposed only on the order and on the
responsibility of the general in chief.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;ARTICLE 42.&mdash;Requisitions shall be made only by the authority
of the commandant of the locality occupied.&quot;</p></div>

<p>These conclusions are substantially followed in the
chapter on the &quot;Customs of War&quot; contained in the <i>Manual
of Military Law</i> issued for the use of officers by the British
War Office.</p>

<p>The bombardment of an unfortified town would, I
conceive, be lawful&mdash;(1) as a punishment for disloyal
conduct; (2) in extreme cases, as retaliation for disloyal
conduct elsewhere; (3) for the purpose of quelling armed
resistance (not as a punishment for resistance when quelled);
(4) in case of refusal of reasonable supplies requisitioned,
or of a reasonable money contribution in lieu of supplies.
It would, I conceive, be unlawful&mdash;(1) for the purpose of
enforcing a fancy contribution or ransom, such as we were
told was exacted from Liverpool; (2) by way of wanton
injury to private property, such as was supposed to have
been caused in the Clyde and at Folkestone, and <i>a fortiori</i>
such as would have resulted from the anticipated shelling
during the night-time of the south coast of the Isle of Wight.</p>

<p>2. Is it the case that international law is &quot;all nonsense,&quot;
and that &quot;when we are at war with an enemy he will do
his best to injure us: he will do so in what way he thinks
proper, all treaties and all so-called international law
<span class="newpage"><a name="page116" id="page116">[116]</a></span>notwithstanding&quot;? Are we, with Admiral Aube, to
speak of &quot;cette monstrueuse association de mots: les
droits de la guerre&quot;? If so, <i>cadit qu&aelig;stio</i>, and a vast
amount of labour has been wasted during the last three
centuries. I can only say that such a view of the future
is not in accordance with the teachings of the past. The
body of accepted usage, supplemented by special conventions,
which is known as international law, has, as a matter
of fact, exercised, even in time of war, a re staining influence
on national conduct. This assertion might be illustrated
from the discussions which have arisen during recent wars
with reference to the Geneva Conventions to the treatment
of the wounded and the St. Petersburg declaration against
the use of explosive bullets. The binding obligation of
these instruments, which would doubtless be classed by
your correspondent with the fleet among &quot;old-fashioned
treaties, protocols, and other diplomatic documents,&quot; has
never been doubted, while each party has eagerly
endeavoured to disprove alleged infractions of them.</p>

<p>The naval man&oelig;uvres have doubtless taught many
lessons of practical seamanship. They will have done
good service of another sort if they have brought to the
attention of responsible statesmen such questions as those
with which I have attempted to deal. It is essential that
the country should know the precise extent of the risks to
which our seaboard towns will be exposed in time of war,
and it is desirable that our naval forces should be warned
against any course of action, in their conduct of mimic
warfare, which could be cited against us, in case we should
ever have to complain of similar action on the part of a
real enemy.</p>

<p class="lettertitle"><a name="THE-NAVAL-MANOEUVRES-B" />THE NAVAL MAN&OElig;UVRES</p>

<p>Sir,&mdash;In my first letter I called attention to certain
operations of the <i>Spider</i> and her consorts which seemed
to be inspired by no principle beyond that of doing
unlimited mischief to the enemy's seaboard. In a second
letter I endeavoured to distinguish between the mischief
which would and that which would not be regarded as
permissible in civilised warfare. The correspondence which
has subsequently appeared in your columns has made
sufficiently clear the opposition between the view which
seems to find favour just now in naval circles and the
principles of international law, as I have attempted to
define them. The question between my critics and myself
is, in effect, whether the medi&aelig;val or the modern view
as to the treatment of private property is to prevail.
According to the former, all such property is liable to be
seized or destroyed, in default of a &quot;Brandschatz,&quot; or
ransom. According to the latter, it is inviolable, subject
only to certain well-defined exceptions, among which
reasonable requisitions of supplies would be recognised,
while demands of money contributions, as such, would not
be recognised.</p>

<p>The evidence in favour of the modern view being what
I have stated it to be is, indeed, overwhelming; but I
should like to call special attention to the <i>Manuel de Droit
International &agrave; l'Usage des Officiers de l'Arm&eacute;e de Terre</i>,
issued by the French Government, as going even further
than the Brussels Conference in the restrictions which it
imposes upon the levying of requisitions and contributions.
The Duke of Wellington, who used to be thought an
authority in these matters, wrote in 1844, with reference
to a pamphlet in which the Prince de Joinville had advocated
depredations on the English coasts:&mdash;</p>

<div class="letterquot"><p>&quot;What but the inordinate desire of popularity could have induced
<span class="newpage"><a name="page118" id="page118">[118]</a></span>a man in his station to write and publish an invitation and provocation
to war, to be carried on in a manner such as has been disclaimed by
the civilised portions of mankind?&quot;</p></div>

<p>The naval historian, Mr. Younge, in commenting on
the burning of Paita, in Chili, as far back as 1871, for
non-compliance with a demand for a money contribution
(ultimately reduced to a requisition of provisions for the
ships), speaks of it as &quot;worthy only of the most lawless
pirate or buccaneer, ... as a singular proof of how completely
the principles of civilised warfare were conceived
to be confined to Europe.&quot;</p>

<p>Such exceptional acts as the burning of Paita, or the
bombardment of Valparaiso, mentioned by Mr. Herries,
will, of course, occur from time to time. My position is
that they are so far stigmatised as barbarous by public
opinion that their perpetration in civilised warfare may be
regarded as improbable; in other words, that they are
forbidden by international law.</p>

<p>It is a further question whether the rules of international
law on this point are to be changed or disregarded in future.
Do we expect, and are we desirous, that future wars shall
be conducted in accordance with buccaneering precedent,
or with what has hitherto been the general practice of the
nineteenth century? Your naval correspondents incline
to revert to buccaneering and thus to the introduction into
naval coast operations of a rigour long unknown to the
operations of military forces on land; but they do so with
a difference. Lord Charles Beresford (writing early in the
controversy) asserts the permissibility of ransoming and
destroying, without any qualifying expressions; while
Admiral de Horsey would apparently only ask &quot;rich&quot;
towns for contributions, insisting also that a contribution
must be &quot;reasonable,&quot; and expressly repudiating any
claim to do &quot;wanton injury to property of poor communities,
and still less to individuals.&quot; In the light of
these concessions, I venture to claim Admiral de Horsey's
<span class="newpage"><a name="page119" id="page119">[119]</a></span>concurrence in my condemnation of most of the doings
mentioned in my first letter, although on the whole he
ranges himself on the side of the advocates of what I
maintain to be a change in the existing law of war.
Whether or no the existing law needs revision is a question
for politicians and for military and naval experts. It is
within my province only to express a hope that the
contradiction between existing law and new military necessities
(if, indeed, such contradiction exists) will not be solved by
a repudiation of all law as &quot;nonsense&quot;; and, further,
that, if a change of law is to be effected, it will be done
with due deliberation and under a sense of responsibility.
It should be remembered that operations conducted with
the apparent approval of the highest naval authorities,
and letters in <i>The Times</i> from distinguished admirals, are
in truth the stuff that public opinion, and in particular
that department of public opinion known as &quot;international
law,&quot; is made of.</p>

<p>The ignorance, by the by, which certain of my critics
have displayed of the nature and claims of international
law is not a little surprising. Some seem to identify it
with treaties; others with &quot;Vattel.&quot; Several, having
become aware that it is not law of the kind which is
enforced by a policeman or a County Court bailiff, have
hastened, much exhilarated, to give the world the benefit
of their discovery. Most of them are under the impression
that it has been concocted by &quot;bookworms,&quot; &quot;jurists,&quot;
&quot;professors,&quot; or other &quot;theorists,&quot; instead of, as is the
fact, mainly by statesmen, diplomatists, prize courts,
generals and admirals. This is, however, a wide field, into
which I must not stray. I have even avoided the pleasant
by-paths of disquisition on contraband, privateering, and
the Declaration of Paris generally, into which some of
your correspondents have courteously invited me. I fear

<p class="lettertitle"><a name="NAVAL-BOMBARDMENTS-OF-UNFORTIFIED-PLACES" />NAVAL BOMBARDMENTS OF UNFORTIFIED PLACES</p>

<p>Sir,&mdash;The protest reported to have been lodged by the
Russian Government against the bombardment by the
Japanese fleet of a quarantine station on the island of
San-shan-tao, apart from questions of fact, as to which
we have as yet no reliable information, recalls attention
to a question of international law of no slight importance&mdash;<i>viz.</i>
under what, if any, circumstances it is permissible
for a naval force to bombard an &quot;open&quot; coast town.</p>

<p>In the first place, it may be hardly necessary to point
out the irrelevancy of the reference, alleged to have been
made in the Russian Note, to &quot;Article 25 of The Hague
Convention.&quot; The Convention and the <i>R&egrave;glement</i> annexed
to it are, of course, exclusively applicable to &quot;la guerre
sur terre.&quot; Not only, however, would any mention of
a naval bombardment have been out of place in that
<i>R&egrave;glement</i>, but a proposal to bring such action within the
scope of its 25th Article, which prohibits &quot;the attack or
bombardment of towns, villages, habitations, or buildings
which are not defended,&quot; was expressly negatived by the
Conference of The Hague. It became abundantly clear,
during the discussion of this proposal, that the only
chance of an agreement being arrived at was that any
allusion to maritime warfare should be carefully avoided.
It was further ultimately admitted, even by the advocates
of the proposal, that the considerations applicable to
bombardments by an army and by a naval force respectively
are not identical. It was, for instance, urged that
an army has means other than those which may alone be
<span class="newpage"><a name="page121" id="page121">[121]</a></span>available to a fleet for obtaining from an open town absolutely
needful supplies. The Hague Conference, therefore,
left the matter where it found it, recording, however,
among its &quot;pious wishes&quot; (<i>v&oelig;ux</i>) one to the effect &quot;that
the proposal to regulate the question of the bombardment
of ports, towns, and villages by a naval force should be
referred for examination to a future conference.&quot;</p>

<p>The topic is not a new one. You, Sir, allowed me
to raise it in your columns with reference to the naval
man&oelig;uvres of 1888, when a controversy ensued which
disclosed the existence of a considerable amount of naval
opinion in favour of practices which I ventured to think
in contravention of international law. It was also
thoroughly debated in 1896 at the Venice meeting of the
Institut de Droit International upon a report drafted by
myself, as chairman of a committee appointed a year
previously. This report lays down that the restrictions
placed by international law upon bombardments on land
apply also to those effected from the sea, except that such
operations are lawful for a naval force when undertaken
with a view to (1) obtaining supplies of which it is in need;
(2) destroying munitions of war or warships which may
be in a port; (3) punishing, by way of reprisal, violations
by the enemy of the laws of war. Bombardments for the
purpose of exacting a ransom or of putting pressure upon
the hostile Power by injury to peaceful individuals or their
property were to be unlawful. The views of the committee
were, in substance, adopted by the Institut, with the
omission only of the paragraph allowing bombardment by
way of reprisals.</p>

<div class="postnotes"><p>The &quot;Hague Conference&quot; and &quot;Hague Convention&quot; to which
reference was made in the last of these letters were, of course, those
of 1899.</p>

<p>For the action taken by the Institut de Droit International in 1895
<span class="newpage"><a name="page122" id="page122">[122]</a></span>and 1896, on the initiative of the present writer, see the <i>Annuaire de
l'Institut</i>, t. xiv p. 295, t. xv. pp. 145-151, 309, 317; and his
<i>Studies in International Law</i>, pp. 106-111. See also, at p. 104 of the
same work, an opinion given by him to the Chevalier Tindal as to the
liability of The Hague to be bombarded.</p>

<p>The later growth of opinion has been in accordance with the views
maintained by the writer of these letters, and with the <i>Rapport</i> drafted
by him for the Institut. The Hague Conference of 1899, though
unable to discuss the subject, had registered a <i>v&aelig;u</i> &quot;that the proposal
to regulate the question of the bombardment of ports, towns and
villages by a naval force may be referred for examination to a future
Conference.&quot; See <i>Parl. Paper, Miscell.</i> No. 1 (1889), pp. 139, 146,
162, 165, 258, 283. At the Conference of 1907 a Convention, No. ix.,
was accordingly signed and generally ratified, notably by Germany and
Great Britain, Art. 1 of which prohibits &quot;the bombardment by naval
forces of ports towns, villages, houses, or buildings which are not
defended,&quot; Germany, France, Great Britain and Japan dissenting
from the second paragraph of this article, which explains that a place is
not to be considered to be defended merely because it is protected by
submarine contact-mines. Bombardment is, however, permitted, by
Art. 2, of places which are, in fact, military or naval bases, and, by
Arts. 3 and 4, of places which refuse to comply with reasonable requisitions
for food needed by the fleet, though not for refusal of money contributions.
The <i>Acte Final</i> of the Conference further registers a <i>v&aelig;u</i> that
&quot;the Powers should, in all cases, apply, as far as possible, to war at sea
the principles of the Convention concerning the laws and customs
of war on land.&quot; (<i>Parl. Paper, Miscell.</i> No. 1 (1908), p. 30.) This
Convention, No. iv. of 1907, in Art. 25 of the <i>R&egrave;glement</i> annexed to it,
lays down that &quot;the attack or bombardment, by whatsoever means,
of towns, villages, habitations, or buildings which are not defended
is prohibited.&quot;</p>

<p>The British Government had, in 1907, so far departed from the
Admiralty views of 1888 as to instruct their delegates to the Conference
of that year to the effect that &quot;the Government consider that the
objection, on humanitarian grounds, to the bombardment of unfortified
towns is too strong to justify a resort to that measure, even
though it may be permissible under the abstract doctrines of international
law [?]. They wish it, however, to be clearly understood that
any general prohibition of such practice must not be held to apply to
such operations as the bombardment of towns or places used as bases
or storehouses of naval or military equipment or supply, or ports
containing fighting ships, and that the landing of troops, or anything
partaking of the character of a military or naval operation, is also not
covered.&quot;<span class="newpage"><a name="page123" id="page123">[123]</a></span></p>

<p>It is hardly necessary to chronicle the indignation aroused by
the raids upon undefended coast towns carried out by German cruisers
during the war of 1914, in violation of modern International Law
and notwithstanding the German ratification of Convention No. ix.
of 1907.</p></div>

<p>Sir,&mdash;The controversy as to the legitimacy of the
recent attack on Freiburg tends to stray into irrelevancies.
If the attack was made upon barracks or troop trains no
one would surely criticise what is of everyday occurrence,
although not unlikely to cause incidentally death or injury
to innocent persons. There seems, however, to be no
reason for supposing that such military objects were in
view, or that our aeroplanes were instructed to confine
their activity, as far as possible, to the attainment of such
objects. We must assume, for any useful discussion of
the question raised, that the operation was deliberately
intended to result in injury to the property and persons
of civilian inhabitants, not, of course, by way of vengeance,
but by way of reprisal&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> with the practical object of
inducing the enemy to abstain in the future from his
habitually practised illegal barbarities. Such reprisals, as is
to-day so well explained by your correspondent &quot;Jurist,&quot;
are no violations of international law. Objections might,
of course, be made to them as unlikely to produce their
hoped-for effect, or as repugnant to our feelings of humanity
or honour. They are not illegal.</p>

<p>Sir,&mdash;If my friend Sir Edward Clarke will glance again
at my letter of Monday, he will, I think, cease to be surprised
that it contains no answer to his censure from an ethical
standpoint of our treatment of Freiburg. My object
was merely to indicate the desirability of keeping the
question whether acts of the kind are in violation of
international law (which I answered in the negative) distinct
from questions, which I catalogued, as to their practical
inutility, with which some of your correspondents have
occupied themselves, or their repugnancy to feelings of
honour and humanity with which Sir Edward has dealt
exclusively. Any discussion of political expediency or of
high morals would have been beside my purpose.</p>

<p>It is curious that Sir Herbert Stephen should to-day
speak of my letter of the 7th as a defence of the
aerial bombardment of Freiburg. It neither attacked nor
defended the bombardment, but, solely in the interests
of clear thinking, indicated the desirability of keeping
distinct the three points of view from which the topic may
be regarded, <i>viz.</i>: (1) of international law;
(2) of practical utility; (3) of morality and honour.</p>

<p class="lettertitle"><a name="UNDESIRABLE-PEACE-TALK" />UNDESIRABLE PEACE TALK</p>

<p>Sir,&mdash;There has been more than enough of premature
discussion by groups of well-meaning amateurs, not unfrequently
wirepulled by influences hostile to this country,
<span class="newpage"><a name="page125" id="page125">[125]</a></span>with reference to the terms of the treaty of peace by which
the world-war now raging will be brought to a close.</p>

<p>Movements of the kind have culminated in the action
of a body rejoicing in the somewhat cumbrous title of the
&quot;International Central Organisation for a Durable Peace,&quot;
which is inviting members of about fifty societies, of very
varying degrees of competence, to a cosmopolitan meeting,
to be held at Berne in December next. Lest the unwary
should be beguiled into having anything to do with the
plausible offer made to them that they should, there and
then, assist in compiling &quot;a scientific dossier, containing
material that will be of vast importance to the diplomats
who may be chosen to participate in the peace congress itself,&quot;
it may be worth while to call attention to the composition
of the executive committee by which the invitations
are issued, and to its &quot;minimum programme.&quot;</p>

<p>Of the members of this committee (of thirteen), on
which Great Britain is represented only by Mr. Lowes
Dickenson (mistakenly described as a Cambridge Professor),
and America only by Mrs. Andrews, of Boston, the best
known are Professors Lammasch, of Vienna, and Sch&uuml;cking,
of Marburg. The &quot;minimum programme&quot; demands, <i>inter
alia</i>, &quot;equal rights for all nations in the colonies, &amp;c.,&quot;
of the Powers; submission of all disputes to &quot;pacific
procedure,&quot; joint action by the Powers against any one
of them resorting to military measures, rather than to
such procedure; and that &quot;the right of prize shall be
abolished, and the freedom of the seas shall be guaranteed.&quot;
The <i>provenance</i> of this &quot;minimum programme&quot; is
sufficiently obvious. What is likely to be the character
of such a &quot;maximum programme&quot; as will doubtless be
aimed at by the proposed gathering?</p>

<div class="intronotes"><p>The main object of the first of the following letters was to assert, as
against any possible misunderstanding of phraseology attributed to
a great international lawyer (since lost to science and to his friends by
his sudden death on June 20, 1909), the authority by which alone
neutral rights and duties are defined.</p>

<p>The letter also touches upon the limit of time which a neutral
Power is bound to place upon the stay in its ports of belligerent ships
of war; a topic more fully discussed in Section 4.</p></div>


<p class="lettertitle"><a name="PROFESSOR-DE-MARTENS-ON-THE-SITUATION" />PROFESSOR DE MARTENS ON THE SITUATION</p>

<p>Sir,&mdash;The name of my distinguished friend, M. de
Martens, carries so much weight that I hope you will allow
me at once to say that I am convinced that to-day's
telegraphic report of some communication made by him to
the St. Petersburg newspapers fails to convey an accurate
account of the views which he has thus expressed.</p>

<p>On matters of fact it would appear that he is no better
informed than are most of us in this country; and under
matters of fact may be included the breaches of neutrality
which he is represented as counter-charging against the
Japanese. It is exclusively with the views on questions of
law which are attributed to Professor de Martens that I am
now concerned. He is unquestionably right in saying, as I
pointed out in a recent letter, that the hard-and-fast rule,
<span class="newpage"><a name="page127" id="page127">[127]</a></span>fixing 24 hours as the limit, under ordinary circumstances,
of the stay of a belligerent warship in neutral waters, is not
yet universally accepted as a rule of international law;
and, in particular, is not adopted by France.</p>

<p>But what of the further <i>dictum</i> attributed to Professor
de Martens, to the effect that &quot;each country is its own judge
as regards the discharge of its duties as a neutral&quot;? This
statement would be a superfluous truism if it meant merely
that each country, when neutral, must, in the first instance,
decide for itself what courses of action are demanded from
it under the circumstances. The words may, however, be
read as meaning that the decision of the neutral country,
as to the propriety of its conduct, is final, and not to be
questioned by other Powers. An assertion to this effect
would obviously be the negation of the whole system of
international law, of which Professor de Martens is so great
a master, resting, as that system does, not on individual
caprice, but upon the agreement of nations in restraint of
the caprice of any one of them. The last word, with reference
to the propriety of the conduct of any given State,
rests, of course, not with that State; but with its neighbours.
&quot;Securus indicat orbis terrarum.&quot; Any Power which fails
in the discharge, to the best of its ability, of a generally
recognised duty, is likely to find that self-satisfaction is no
safeguard against unpleasant consequences. Professor de
Martens would, I am certain, endorse this statement.</p>

<p class="lettertitle"><a name="NEUTRALS-AND-THE-LAWS-OF-WAR" />NEUTRALS AND THE LAWS OF WAR</p>

<p>Sir,&mdash;The interesting address by Sir Edward Carson
reported in your issue of yesterday will remind many of
us of our regret that President Wilson, in Notes complaining
of injuries sustained by American citizens, dwelt so slightly
<span class="newpage"><a name="page128" id="page128">[128]</a></span>upon the violations of international law by which those
injuries were brought about.</p>

<p>Sir Edward seems, however, to have made use of certain
expressions which might be taken to imply a view of neutral
responsibility which can hardly be accepted. The United
States were warned in the address that they will not &quot;by
a mere Note maintain the obligations which are put upon
them, as parties to international law, which are to prevent
breaches of civilisation and to mitigate the horrors of war.&quot;
Neutrals were spoken of as &quot;the executives of international
law,&quot; and as alone standing &quot;behind the conventions&quot;
(for humanising warfare). &quot;Abolish,&quot; we were told, &quot;the
power of neutrals, and you have abolished international
law itself.&quot;</p>

<p>Is this so? The contract into which a State enters with
other States, by adopting the customary laws of war and
by ratifying express Conventions dealing with the same
subject, obliges it, while remaining neutral, to submit to
certain inconveniences resulting from the war, and, when
belligerent, to abstain from certain modes of carrying on
hostilities. It is assuredly no term of the contract that
the State in question shall sit in judgment upon its co-contractors
and forcibly intervene in <i>rebus inter alios actis</i>.
Its hands are absolutely free. It may remain a quiescent
spectator of evil, or, if strong enough and indignant with
the wrongdoing, may endeavour to abate the mischief
by remonstrance, and, in the last resort, by taking sides
against the offender. Let us hope that at the present crisis
the United States may see their way to choosing the better part.</p>

<p class="subsectionhead">The Duties of Neutral States, and the Liabilities of Neutral
Individuals, distinguished</p>

<div class="intronotes">
<p>The duties of neutral States have been classified by the present
writer under the heads, of &quot;Abstention,&quot; &quot;Prevention,&quot; and &quot;Acquiescence.&quot;
(<i>Transactions of the British Academy</i>, vol. ii, p. 55; reproduced
in the <i>Revue de Droit International</i>, the <i>Revista de Derecho International</i>,
and the <i>Marine Rundschau</i>.) In the three letters which follow, an
attempt is made to point out the confusion which has resulted from
failure to distinguish between the two last-mentioned heads of neutral
duty; on the one hand, namely, the cases in which a neutral government
is bound itself to come forward and take steps to prevent certain classes
of action on the part of belligerents, or of its own subjects, <i>e.g.</i> the overstay
in its ports of belligerent fleets, or the export from its shores of
ships of war for belligerent use; and, on the other hand, the cases in
which the neutral government is bound only to passively acquiesce in
interference by belligerents with the commerce of such of its subjects
as may choose, at their own risk and peril, to engage in carriage of
contraband, breach of blockade, and the like.</p>

<p>I. A neutral State is bound to prevent its territory from becoming,
in any way, a &quot;base of operations&quot; for either belligerent. Of the
various obligations thus arising, the following letters deal with the duty
of the State (1) to prevent the departure from its ports of vessels
carrying coal intended to supply directly the needs of a belligerent
fleet; and (2) to prevent the reception accorded in its ports to belligerent
warships from being such as will unduly facilitate their subsequent
operations. It is pointed out that the rule adopted by the
United States and this country, as well as by some others, when neutral,
by which the stay of belligerent warships is limited to twenty-four
hours, has not been adopted by the nations of the European continent.
The attempt made at The Hague Conference of 1907 to secure the
general acceptance of this rule was unsuccessful; and Convention
No. xiii. of that year, not yet ratified by Great Britain, which deals
with this subject, merely lays down, in Art. 12, that &quot;<i>In the absence of
special provisions to the contrary in the legislation of a neutral Power</i>,
belligerent warships are not permitted to remain in the ports, roadsteads,
or territorial waters of the said Power for more than twenty-four
hours, except in the cases covered by this Convention.&quot; Art. 27 obliges
the contracting Powers to &quot;communicate to each other in due course
all laws, proclamations, and other enactments, regulating in their
<span class="newpage"><a name="page130" id="page130">[130]</a></span>respective countries the <i>Status</i> of belligerent warships in their ports
laid waters.&quot;</p>

<p>II. A neutral State is not bound to prevent such assistance being
rendered by its subjects to either belligerent as is involved in, <i>e.g.</i>
blockade-running or carriage of contraband; but merely to acquiesce
in the loss and inconvenience which may in consequence be inflicted
by the belligerents upon persons so acting. In order to explain this
statement, it became necessary to say much as to the true character
of &quot;carriage of contraband&quot; (although this topic is more specifically
dealt with in the letters contained in Section 5), and to point out that
such carriage is neither a breach of international law nor forbidden
by the law of England. For the same reason, it seemed desirable to
criticise some of the clauses now usually inserted in British Proclamations
of Neutrality.</p>

<p>The view here maintained commended itself to the Institut de
Droit International, at its Cambridge and Venice sessions, 1895, 1896,
as against the efforts of MM Kleen and Brusa to impose on States a
duty of preventing carriage of contraband by its subjects (<i>Annuaire</i>,
t. xiv. p. 191, t. xv. p. 205). It has now received formal expression in
The Hague Convention No. x. of 1907, Art. 7 of which lays down that
&quot;a neutral Power is <i>not</i> bound to prevent the export or transit, for
the use of either belligerent, of arms, ammunition, or, in general, of
anything which could be of use to an army or fleet.&quot;</p>
</div>


<p class="lettertitle"><a name="CONTRABAND-OF-WAR-1904" />CONTRABAND OF WAR</p>

<p>Sir,&mdash;As a good deal of discussion is evidently about to
take place as to the articles which may be properly treated
as contraband of war, and, in particular, as to coal being
properly so treated, I venture to think that it may be
desirable to reduce this topic (a sufficiently large one) to its
true dimensions by distinguishing it from other topics with
which it is too liable to be confused.</p>

<p>Articles are &quot;contraband of war&quot; which a belligerent
is justified in intercepting while in course of carriage to his
enemy, although such carriage is being effected by a neutral
vessel. Whether any given article should be treated as
contraband is, in the first instance, entirely a question for
the belligerent Government and its Prize Court. A neutral
Government has no right to complain, of hardships which
may thus be incurred by vessels sailing under its flag, but
<span class="newpage"><a name="page131" id="page131">[131]</a></span>is bound to acquiesce in the views maintained by the
belligerent Government and its Courts, unless these views
involve, in the language employed by Lord Granville in
1861, &quot;a flagrant violation of international law.&quot; This is
the beginning and end of the doctrine of contraband. A
neutral Government has none other than this passive duty
of acquiescence. Its neutrality would not be compromised
by the shipment from its shores, and the carriage by its
merchantmen, of any quantity of cannon, rifles, and gunpowder.</p>

<p>Widely different from the above are the following three
topics, into the consideration of which discussions upon
contraband occasionally diverge:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. The international duty of the neutral Government
not to allow its territory to become a base of belligerent
operations: <i>e.g.</i> by the organisation on its shores of an
expedition, such as that which in 1828 sailed from Plymouth
in the interest of Dona Maria; by the despatch from its
harbours for belligerent use of anything so closely resembling
an expedition as a fully equipped ship of war (as was argued
in the case of the <i>Alabama</i>); by the use of its ports by
belligerent ships of war for the reception of munitions of war,
or, except under strict limitations, for the renewal of their
stock of coal; or by such an employment of its colliers as was
alleged during the Franco-Prussian war to have implicated
British merchantmen in the hostile operations of the French
fleet in the North Sea. The use of the term &quot;contraband&quot;
with reference to the failure of a neutral State to prevent
occurrences of this kind is purely misleading.</p>

<p>2. The powers conferred upon a Government by legislation
of restraining its subjects from intermeddling in a
war in which the Government takes no part. Of such
legislation our Foreign Enlistment Act is a striking example.
The large powers conferred by it have no commensurable
relation to the duties which attach to the position of
neutrality. Its effect is to enable the Government to pro<span class="newpage"><a name="page132" id="page132">[132]</a></span>hibit
and punish, from abundant caution, many acts on the
part of its subjects for which it would incur no international
liability. It does empower the Government to prevent the
use of its territory as a base: <i>e.g.</i> by aid directly rendered
thence to a belligerent fleet; but it, of course, gives no right
of interference with the export or carriage of articles which
may be treated as contraband.</p>

<p>3. The powers conferred upon a Government by such
legislation as section 150 of the Customs Consolidation Act;
1853, now reproduced in a later enactment, of forbidding at
any time, by Order in Council, the export of articles useful
in war. The power thus given has no relation to international
duty, and is mainly intended to be exercised, in the
way of self-protection, when Great Britain is, or is likely to
be, engaged in war. The object of the enactment is to
enable the Government to retain in the country articles of
which we may ourselves be in need, or to prevent them from
reaching the hands of our enemies. The articles enumerated&mdash;<i>e.g.</i>
arms, ammunition, marine engines, &amp;c.&mdash;are, neither

<p class="lettertitle"><a name="COAL-FOR-THE-RUSSIAN-FLEET" />COAL FOR THE RUSSIAN FLEET</p>

<p>Sir,&mdash;The use of coal for belligerent purposes is, of course,
of comparatively modern date, and it is hardly surprising
to find that the mercantile community, as would appear
from your marine insurance article of this morning, does
not clearly distinguish between the different classes of
questions to which such use may give rise. There is indeed
a widely prevalent confusion, even in quarters which ought
to be better informed, between two topics which it is
essential to keep separate&mdash;<i>viz.</i> the shipment of contraband,
<span class="newpage"><a name="page133" id="page133">[133]</a></span>and the use of neutral territory as a base for belligerent
operations.</p>

<p>A neutral Government (our own at the present moment)
occupies a very different position with reference to these
two classes of acts. With reference to the former, its international
duty (as also its national policy) is merely one of
acquiescence. It is bound to stand aside, and make no
claim to protect from the recognised consequences of their
acts such of its subjects as are engaged in carriage of contraband.
So far as the neutral Government is concerned,
its subjects may carry even cannon and gunpowder to a
belligerent port, while the belligerent, on the other hand,
who is injured by the trade may take all necessary stops to
suppress it.</p>

<p>Such is the compromise which long experience has
shown to be both reasonable and expedient between the, in
themselves irreconcilable, claims of neutral and belligerent
States. So far, it has remained unshaken by the arguments
of theorists, such as the Swedish diplomatist M. Kleen, who
would impose upon neutral Governments the duty of
preventing the export of contraband by their subjects.
A British trader may, therefore, at his own proper risk,
despatch as many thousand tons of coal as he chooses,
just as he may despatch any quantity of rifles or bayonets,
to Vladivostok or to Nagasaki.</p>

<p>It by no means follows that British shipowners may
charter their vessels &quot;for such purposes as following the
Russian fleet with coal supplies.&quot; Lord Lansdowne's recent
letter to Messrs. Woods, Tylor, and Brown is explicit to the
effect that such conduct is &quot;not permissible.&quot; Lord Lansdowne
naturally confined himself to answering the question
which had been addressed by those gentlemen to the Foreign
Office; but the reason for his answer is not far to seek.
The unlawfulness of chartering British vessels for the purpose
above mentioned is wholly unconnected with the doctrine of
contraband, but is a consequence of the international duty,
<span class="newpage"><a name="page134" id="page134">[134]</a></span>which if incumbent on every neutral State, of seeing that its
territory is not made a base of belligerent operations. The
question was thoroughly threshed out as long ago as 1870,
when Mr. Gladstone said in the House Of Commons that the
Government had adopted the opinion of the law officers:</p>

<div class="letterquot"><p>&quot;That if colliers are chartered for the purpose of attending the fleet
of a belligerent and supplying it with coal, to enable it to pursue its
hostile operations, such colliers would, to all practical purposes, become
store-ships to the fleet, and would be liable, if within reach, to the
operation of the English law under the (old) Foreign Enlistment Act.&quot;</p></div>

<p>British colliers attendant on a Russian fleet would be so
undeniably aiding and abetting the operations of that fleet
as to give just cause of complaint against us to the Government
of Japan. The British shipper of coal to a belligerent
fleet at sea, besides thus laying his Government open to a
charge of neglect of an international duty, lays himself open
to criminal proceedings under the Foreign Enlistment Act
of 1870. By section 8 (3) and (4) of that Act &quot;any person
within H.M. Dominions&quot; who (subject to certain exceptions)
equips or despatches any ship, with intent, or knowledge,
that the same will be employed in the military or naval
service of a foreign State, at war with any friendly State,
is liable to fine or imprisonment, and to the forfeiture of
the ship. By section 30, &quot;naval service&quot; covers &quot;user as a
store-ship,&quot; and &quot;equipping&quot; covers furnishing a ship with
&quot;stores or any other thing which is used in or about a ship
for the purpose of adapting her for naval service.&quot; Our
Government has, therefore, ample powers for restraining, in
this respect, the use of its territory as a base. It has no
power, had it the wish (except for its own protection, under a
different statute), to restrain the export of contraband of war.</p>

<p>It would tend to clearness of thought if the term &quot;contraband&quot;
were never employed in discussions with reference to
prohibition of the supply of coal to a belligerent fleet at sea.</p>

<p class="lettertitle"><a name="GERMAN-WAR-MATERIAL-FOR-TURKEY" />GERMAN WAR MATERIAL FOR TURKEY</p>

<p>Sir,&mdash;The <i>Cologne Gazette</i> rightly treats as incredible
the rumour, mentioned by your Sofia Correspondent, that
a trainload of munitions of war had been despatched by
the German Government for the use of Turkey, while
admitting that such a consignment may very likely have
been forwarded from private German workshops.</p>

<p>It has long been settled international law that a neutral
Government, while, on the one hand, it is precluded from
itself supplying munitions to a belligerent, is, on the other
hand, not bound to prevent private individuals from so
acting. The latter half of this rule has now received written
expression in Art. 7 of The Hague Convention No. v. of
1907, which deals with &quot;Neutral Powers and Persons in
War on Land.&quot;</p>

<p>The only fault to be found with the paragraph in the
<i>Cologne Gazette</i> quoted by your Berlin Correspondent,
supposing it to be correctly transcribed, would be that it
seems to imply that the above-mentioned Art. 7 legitimatises
the supply of war material to belligerents by &quot;neutral
States.&quot; It is, however, obvious from the rest of the
paragraph that the <i>Gazette</i> is not really under that impression.</p>

<p class="lettertitle"><a name="THE-BRITISH-PROCLAMATION-OF-NEUTRALITY-1904" />THE BRITISH PROCLAMATION OF
NEUTRALITY</p>


<p>Sir,&mdash;You were good enough to insert in your issue of
November 9 some observations which I had addressed to
you upon the essential difference between carriage of
contraband, which takes place at the risk of the neutral
shipowner, and use of neutral territory as a base for belligerent
operations, an act which may implicate the neutral
Power internationally, while also rendering the shipper
liable to penal proceedings on the part of his own Government.
I am gratified, to find that the views thus expressed
by me are in exact accordance with those set forth by Lord
Lansdowne in his reply of November 25 to the Chamber of
Shipping of the United Kingdom. Perhaps you will allow
me to say something further upon the same subject,
suggested by several letters which appear in your paper of
this morning. I am especially desirous of emphasising the
proposition that carriage of contraband is no offence, either
against international law or against the law of England.</p>

<p>1. The rule of international law upon the subject may,
I think, be expressed as follows: &quot;A belligerent is entitled
to capture a neutral ship engaged in carrying contraband of
war to his enemy, to confiscate the contraband cargo, and,
in some cases, to confiscate the ship also, without thereby
giving to, the Power to whose subjects the property in
question belongs any ground for complaint.&quot; Or, to vary
the phrase, &quot;a neutral Power is bound to acquiesce in losses
inflicted by a belligerent upon such of its subjects as are
engaged in adding to the military resources of the enemy of
that belligerent.&quot; This is the rule to which the nations
have consented, as a compromise between the right of the
neutral State that its subjects should carry on their trade
without interruption, and the right of the belligerent State
to prevent that trade from bringing an accession of strength
to his enemy. International law here, as always, deals with
<span class="newpage"><a name="page137" id="page137">[137]</a></span>relations between States, and has nothing to do with the
contraband trader, except in so far as it deprives him of the
protection of his Government. If authority were needed
for what is here advanced, it might be found in Mr. Justice
Story's judgment in the <i>Santissima Trinidad</i>, in President
Pierce's message of 1854, and in the statement by the
French Government in 1898, with reference to the case of
the <i>Fram</i>, that &quot;the neutral State is not required to prevent
the sending of arms and ammunition by its subjects.&quot;</p>

<p>2. Neither is carriage of contraband any offence against
the law of England; as may be learnt, by any one who
is in doubt as to the statement, from the lucid language
of Lord Westbury in <i>Ex parte Chavasse</i> (34 L.J., Bkry.,
17). And this brings me to the gist of this letter. I have
long thought that the form of the Proclamation of
Neutrality now in use in this country much needs
reconsideration and redrafting. The clauses of the Proclamation
which are set out by Mr. Gibson Bowles in your issue of
this morning rightly announce that every person engaging
in breach of blockade or carriage of contraband &quot;will be
justly liable to hostile capture and to the penalties
denounced by the law of nations in that behalf, and will in no
wise obtain protection from us against such capture or such
penalties.&quot; So far, so good. But the Proclamation also
speaks of such acts as those just mentioned as being done
&quot;in contempt of this our Royal Proclamation, in derogation
of their duty as subjects of a neutral Power in a war
between other Powers, or in violation or contravention of
the law of nations in that behalf.&quot; It proceeds to say that
all persons &quot;who may misconduct themselves in the premises
... will incur our high displeasure for such misconduct.&quot;
I venture to submit that all these last-quoted phrases are
of the nature of misleading rhetoric, and should be eliminated
from a statement the effective purport of which is to
warn British subjects of the treatment to which certain
courses of conduct will expose them at the hands of
<span class="newpage"><a name="page138" id="page138">[138]</a></span>belligerents, and to inform them that the British Government
will not protect them against such treatment. The
reason why our Government will abstain from interference
is, not that such courses of action are offences either against
international or English law, but that it has no right to so
interfere; having become a party to a rule of international
law, under which a neutral Government waives the right,
which it would otherwise possess, to protect the trade of its
subjects from molestation.</p>

<p class="lettertitle"><a name="THE-BRITISH-PROCLAMATION-OF-NEUTRALITY-1904-B" />THE BRITISH PROCLAMATION OF
NEUTRALITY</p>

<p>Sir,&mdash;Enquiries which have reached me with reference
to the observations which I recently addressed to you upon
the British Proclamation of Neutrality induce me to think
that some account of the development of the text of the
proclamation now in use may be of interest to your readers.
The proclamations with which I am acquainted conform to
one or other of two main types, each of which has its history.</p>

<p>1. The earlier proclamations merely call attention to the
English law against enlistments, &amp;c., for foreign service;
and command obedience to the law, upon pain of the
penalties thereby inflicted, &quot;and of his Majesty's high
displeasure.&quot; In the proclamation of 1817, the tacit reference
is doubtless to certain Acts of George II, which, having
been passed for a very different purpose, and having proved
inadequate in their new application, were repealed by the
Foreign Enlistment Act of 1819. This is the Act to which
reference is made in the proclamations of 1823 and 1825;
in the former of which we first get a recital of neutrality;
while in the latter the clause enjoining all subjects strictly
to observe the duties of neutrality and to respect the exercise
of belligerent rights first makes its appearance.<span class="newpage"><a name="page139" id="page139">[139]</a></span></p>

<p>2. The proclamation of 1859 is of a very different character,
bearing traces of the influence of the ideas which had
inspired the action of President Washington in 1793. While
carrying on the old, it presents several new features.
British subjects are enjoined to abstain from violating, not
only &quot;the laws and statutes of the realm,&quot; but also (for the
first time) &quot;the law of nations.&quot; They are also (for the
first time) warned that, if any of them &quot;shall presume, in
contempt of this our Royal Proclamation, and of our high
displeasure, to do any acts in derogation of their duty as
subjects of a neutral Sovereign, ... or in violation of
the law of nations, ... as, more especially,&quot; by breach
of blockade, or carriage of contraband, &amp;c., they will &quot;rightfully
incur, and be justly liable to, hostile capture, and to the
penalties denounced by the law of nations in that behalf&quot;;
and notice is (for the first time) given that those &quot;who may
misconduct themselves in the premises will do so at their
peril, and of their own wrong; and that they will in no wise
obtain any protection from Us against such capture, or such
penalties as aforesaid, but will, on the contrary, incur Our
high displeasure by such misconduct.&quot;</p>

<p>The proclamations of 1861 and February and March
1866 complicate matters, by making the warning clause
as to blockade and contraband apply also to the statutory
offences of enlistment, &amp;c.; but the proclamation of June,
1866, gets rid of this complication by returning to the
formula of 1859, which has been also followed in 1870, 1877,
1898, and in the present year.</p>

<p>The formula as it now stands, after the process of growth
already described, may be said to consist of seven parts&mdash;<i>viz.</i>
(1) a recital of neutrality; (2) a command to subjects
to observe a strict neutrality, and to abstain from contravention
of the laws of the realm or the law of nations in
relation thereto; (3) a recital of the Foreign Enlistment
Act of 1870; (4) a command that the statute be obeyed,
upon pain of the penalties thereby imposed, &quot;and of Our
<span class="newpage"><a name="page140" id="page140">[140]</a></span>high displeasure&quot;; (5) a warning to observe the duties of
neutrality, and to respect the exercise of belligerent rights;
(6) a further warning to those who, in contempt of the proclamation
&quot;and of Our high displeasure,&quot; may do any acts
&quot;in derogation of neutral duty, or in violation of the law
of nations,&quot; especially by breach of blockade, carriage of
contraband, &amp;c., that they will be liable to capture &quot;and to
the penalties denounced by the law of nations&quot;; (7) a
notification that persons so misconducting themselves &quot;will
in no wise obtain any protection from Us,&quot; but will, &quot;on the
contrary, incur Our high displeasure by such misconduct.&quot;</p>

<p>The question which I have ventured to raise is whether
the <i>textus receptus</i>, built up, as it has been, by successive
accretions, is sufficiently in accordance with the facts to
which it purports to call the attention of British subjects
to be properly submitted to His Majesty for signature.
I would suggest for consideration: 1. Whether the phrases
commanding obedience, on pain of His Majesty's &quot;high
displeasure,&quot; and the term &quot;misconduct,&quot; should not be
used only with reference to offences recognised as such by
the law of England. 2. Whether such condensed, and
therefore incorrect, though very commonly employed, expressions
as imply that breach of blockade and carriage
of contraband are &quot;in violation of the law of nations,&quot;
and are liable to &quot;the penalties denounced by the law of
nations,&quot; should not be replaced by expressions more
scientifically correct. The law of nations neither prohibits
the acts in question nor prescribes penalties to be incurred
by the doers of them. What it really does is to define
the measures to which a belligerent may resort for the
suppression of such acts, without laying himself open to
remonstrance from the neutral Government to which the
traders implicated owe allegiance.</p>

<p class="lettertitle"><a name="THE-BRITISH-PROCLAMATION-OF-NEUTRALITY-1911" />THE BRITISH PROCLAMATION OF NEUTRALITY</p>

<p>Sir,&mdash;I am glad that Mr. Gibson Bowles has called
attention to certain respects in which the Proclamation of
Neutrality issued by our Government on the 3rd of the
present month differs from that issued on February 11, 1904.</p>

<p>In two letters addressed to you with reference to the
Proclamation of that year, I ventured to point out what
appeared to me to be its defects, alike from a scientific
and from a practical point of view. The present Proclamation
has slightly minimised these defects, but, as a whole,
remains open to the objections which I then raised. I have
no wish to repeat in detail the contents of my letters of
1904, especially as they may be now found in my <i>Letters
upon War and Neutrality</i>, published in 1909, pp. 95 and 98,
but am unwilling not to take this opportunity once more to
urge the desirability of redrafting the document in question.</p>

<p>The Proclamation just issued still answers to my description
of that of 1904, as consisting of seven parts&mdash;<i>viz.</i>:
(1) A recital of neutrality; (2) a command to subjects
to observe a strict neutrality, and to abstain from contravention
of the laws of the realm or the Law of Nations
in relation thereto; (3) a recital of the Foreign Enlistment
Act, 1870; (4) a command that the statute be obeyed,
upon pain of the penalties thereby imposed, and of &quot;Our
high displeasure&quot;; (5) a warning to observe the duties of
neutrality and to respect the exercise of belligerent rights;
(6) a further warning that any persons presuming, in contempt
of the Proclamation, to do acts in derogation of
their duty as subjects of a neutral Power, or of the Law of
Nations, will incur the penalties denounced by such law;
(7) a notice that persons so misconducting themselves will
obtain no protection from their Sovereign.</p>

<p>With the phraseology of No. 1, reciting British neutrality,
and Nos. 2-5, dealing with the duties of British subjects
under the Foreign Enlistment Act of 1870, and constituting
<span class="newpage"><a name="page142" id="page142">[142]</a></span>the bulk of the Proclamation, little serious fault can be found.
It is well that such persons should be warned of the penalties
which they may incur, including the Royal displeasure.</p>

<p>The remaining two clauses relate, however, to matters
of a totally different character from those previously
mentioned, and care should therefore have been taken, but
has not been taken, to make this perfectly clear. I would
further remark upon these clauses: (1) That I agree with
Mr. Bowles in regretting the omission here of the specific
mention made in 1904 of &quot;breach of blockade,&quot; &quot;carriage
of contraband,&quot; &amp;c., as specimens of the acts undoubtedly
contemplated in these two clauses; (2) that it is a mistake
to describe acts of this kind as being in derogation of
&quot;the duty of subjects of a neutral Power,&quot; or &quot;in violation
of the Law of Nations,&quot; or as &quot;liable to the penalties
denounced by such law.&quot; Carriage of contraband, and
acts of the same class, are notoriously not condemned by
English law, neither are they, in any proper sense, breaches
of the Law of Nations, which, speaking scientifically, never
deals with individuals, as such, but only with the rights
and duties of States <i>inter se</i>. What the Law of Nations
really does is, as I said in 1904, &quot;to define the measures to
which a belligerent may resort for the suppression of such
acts, without laying himself open to remonstrance from the
neutral Government to which the traders implicated owe
allegiance&quot;; (3) that on the other hand, I am glad to find
that, in accordance with my suggestion, while it continues
very properly to be stated that persons doing the acts
under discussion &quot;will in no wise obtain any protection
from Us against such capture, &amp;c.,&quot; the further statement
that such persons &quot;will, on the contrary, incur Our high
displeasure by such misconduct,&quot; has now been with equal
propriety omitted.</p>

<p class="lettertitle"><a name="THE-PROCLAMATION-OF-NEUTRALITY" />THE PROCLAMATION OF NEUTRALITY</p>

<p>Sir,&mdash;May I be allowed to point out that two questions
arise upon the recent British Proclamation of Neutrality
which were not, as they should have been, in the House
of Commons last night, kept entirely distinct?</p>

<p>The Government has surely done right in now omitting,
as I suggested in 1904, with reference to certain classes
of acts which are prohibited neither by English nor by
International Law, a phrase announcing that the doers of
them would incur the King's &quot;high displeasure&quot;; while
retaining the warning that doers of such acts must be
prepared for consequences from which their own Government
will not attempt to shield them.</p>

<p>On the other hand, our Government has surely erred
in not specifying, as in previous Proclamations, the sort
of acts to which this warning relates&mdash;<i>viz.</i>, to acts such
as carriage of contraband, enemy service, and breach of
blockade, which differ wholly in character from those
violations of the Foreign Enlistment Act against which the
bulk of the Proclamation is directed. As the Proclamation
now stands, no clear transition is marked between breaches
of English law and the unspecified acts which, though
perfectly legal, will forfeit for the doers of them any
claim to British protection from the consequences involved.
Traders are left to find out as best they may the meaning
of the general words &quot;any acts in derogation of their
duty as subjects of a neutral Power.&quot;</p>

<p class="lettertitle"><a name="BELLIGERENT-FLEETS-IN-NEUTRAL-WATERS" />BELLIGERENT FLEETS IN NEUTRAL WATERS</p>

<p>Sir,&mdash;A novel question as to belligerent responsibilities
would be suggested for solution if, as seems to be reported
in Paris, Admiral Rozhdestvensky over-stayed his welcome
in the waters of Madagascar, although ordered to leave them
by his own Government in compliance with &quot;pressing representations&quot;
on the part of the Government of France.</p>

<p>A much larger question is, however, involved in the discussion
which has arisen as to the alleged neglect by France
to prevent the use of her Cochin-Chinese waters by the
Russians as a base of operations against Japan. We are as
yet in the dark as to what is actually occurring in those
waters, and are, perhaps, for that very reason in a better
position for endeavouring to ascertain what are the obligations
imposed on a neutral in such a case by international law.</p>

<p>It is admitted on all hands that a neutral Power is bound
not to permit the &quot;asylum&quot; which she may grant to ships
of war to be so abused as to render her waters a &quot;base of
operations&quot; for the belligerent to which those ships belong.
Beyond this, international law speaks at present with an
uncertain voice, leaving to each Power to resort to such
measures in detail as may be necessary to ensure the due
performance of a duty which, as expressed in general terms,
is universally recognised.</p>

<p>The rule enforced since 1862 by Great Britain for this
purpose limits the stay of a belligerent warship, under
ordinary circumstances, to a period of twenty-four hours;
and the same provision will be found in the neutrality
proclamations issued last year by, <i>e.g.</i> the United States,
Egypt, China, Denmark, Sweden and Norway. So by<span class="newpage"><a name="page145" id="page145">[145]</a></span>
Japan and Russia in 1898. This rule, convenient and
reasonable as it is, is not yet a rule of international law;
as Lord Percy has had occasion to point out, in replying
to a question addressed to him in the House of Commons.
The proclamations of most of the Continental Powers do
not commit their respective Governments to any period
of time, and the material clauses of the French circular,
to which most attention will be directed at the present time,
merely provide as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="letterquot"><p>&quot;(1) En aucun cas, un bellig&eacute;rant ne peut faire usage d'un port

<p>Under the twenty-four hours rule, the duty of the neutral
Government is clear. Under the French rules, all must
evidently turn upon the wisdom and <i>bonne volont&eacute;</i> of the
officials on the spot, and of the home Government, so far as
it is in touch with them. We have no reason to suppose
that the qualities in question will not characterise the
conduct of the French at the present moment. There can,
however, be no doubt that a better definition of the mode
in which a neutral Power should prevent abusive use of
the asylum afforded by its ports and waters is urgently
required. The point is one which must prominently engage
the attention of the special conference upon the rights and
duties of neutrals, for which a wish was expressed by The<span class="newpage"><a name="page146" id="page146">[146]</a></span>

<p class="lettertitle"><a name="THE-APPAM" />THE APPAM</p>

<p>Sir,&mdash;It is satisfactory to learn that the United States
Neutrality Board has decided adversely to the contention
that the <i>Appam</i> is a German ship of war. Her treatment
as a prize would then, <i>prima facie</i>, seem to be governed
by Art. 21 of The Hague Convention, No. xiii., which
provides for her being released, together with her officers
and crew, while the prize crew is to be interned. This
Convention has been duly ratified both by Germany and
by the United States. Its non-ratification by Great Britain
is, I conceive, irrelevant.</p>

<p>But Germany contends that the situation is governed
by Art. 19, the text of which has been several times set
out in your columns, of the old Convention of 1799. This
may startle those who are acquainted with what occurred
at The Hague in 1907, and I have seen no reference to what
must be the gist of the German argument on the point.
They no doubt argue that the old Convention remains
unrepealed by No. xiii. of The Hague, because the latter
Convention is of no effect, in pursuance of its common form
Art. 28, to the effect that:&mdash;&quot;The provisions of the present
Convention do not apply except between contracting Powers,
and then only if all the belligerents are parties to the
Convention&quot; (which is by no means the case).</p>

<div class="postnotes"><p>Certain reservations on ratification do not affect Arts. 21 or 22.</p>

<p>The State Department ruled that the case did not fall within the
protecting clauses of the Treaty of 1799, which granted asylum only
to ships of war accompanying prizes, whereas the <i>Appam</i> was herself
<span class="newpage"><a name="page147" id="page147">[147]</a></span>a prize. Proceedings by the owners in the local Federal Court for
possession of the ship resulted in a decision in their favour, against
which the Germans are appealing in the Supreme Court. They do
not seem to have raised the objection, mentioned in the letter, as to
the applicability of Convention viii.</p></div>

<p class="subsectionhead">Carriage of Contraband. (Absolute and Conditional Contraband:
Continuous Voyages: Unqualified Captors: The Declaration of London)</p>

<div class="intronotes"><p>The letters included in the preceding sections 2 and 3 touched
incidentally upon carriage of contraband, in relation to other departments
of the law affecting neutrals. The eight letters which follow,
suggested respectively by the Spanish-American, the Boer, and the
Russo-Japanese wars, deal exclusively with this topic, which seems likely
to be henceforth governed no longer only by customary and judge-made
law, but largely also by written rules, such as those suggested by the
unratified Declaration of London of 1909.</p>


<p class="subsectionhead">(Absolute and Conditional Contraband)</p>

<p>The divergence which has so long existed between Anglo-American
and Continental views upon contraband was very noticeable at the
commencement of the war of 1898, which gave occasion to the letter
which immediately follows. While the Spanish Decree of April 23
set out only one list of contraband goods, the United States Instructions
of June 20 recognised two lists&mdash;<i>viz.</i> of &quot;absolute&quot; and of &quot;conditional&quot;
contraband, including under the latter head &quot;coal when destined for a
naval station, a port of call, or a ship or ships of the enemy; materials
for the construction of railways or telegraphs, and money, when such
materials or money are destined for an enemy's forces, provisions,
when destined for an enemy's ship or ships, for a place besieged.&quot;</p>

<p>An answer was thus supplied to the question suggested in this
letter, as to articles <i>ancipitis usus</i>.</p></div>


<p class="lettertitle"><a name="CONTRABAND-OF-WAR-1898" />CONTRABAND OF WAR</p>

<p>Sir,&mdash;I fear that the mercantile community will hardly
profit so much as the managers of the Atlas Steamship Company
seem to expect by the information contained in their
letter which you print this morning. It was, indeed, un<span class="newpage"><a name="page148" id="page148">[148]</a></span>likely
that the courteous reply of the Assistant Secretary of
State at Washington to the enquiry addressed to him by
the New York agents of the company would contain a
declaration of the policy of the United States with reference
to contraband of war. The threefold classification of
&quot;merchandise&quot; (not of &quot;contraband&quot;) quoted in the
reply occurs, in the judgment of the Supreme Court in the
well-known case of the <i>Peterhoff</i> (5 Wallace, 58), but it is
substantially that of Grotius, and has long been accepted in
this country and in the United States, while the Continent
is, generally speaking, inclined to deny the existence of
&quot;contraband by accident,&quot; and to recognise only such
a restricted list of contraband as was contained in the
Spanish decree of April 24 last.</p>

<p>The questions upon which shippers are really desirous of
information (which they are, however, perhaps not likely to
obtain, otherwise than from decisions of prize Courts) are of
a less elementary character. They would like to know what
articles <i>ancipitis usus</i> (&quot;used for purposes of war or peace
according to circumstances&quot;) will be treated by the United
States as contraband, and with what penalty the carriage of
such articles will be visited&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> whether by confiscation or
merely by pre-emption.</p>

</div>

<div class="postnotes"><p>The four letters which next follow also relate to the two classes of
contraband goods, with especial reference to the character attributed
to foodstuffs, coal and cotton.</p>

<p>On foodstuffs, see the <i>Report of the Royal Commission on the Supply
of Food, &amp;c., in Time of War</i>, 1905. <i>Cf.</i> also <i>infra.</i>, pp. <a href="#page174">174</a>, <a href="#page176">176</a>, <a href="#page177">177</a>.
They were placed by the unratified Declaration of London, Art. 24,
in the class of conditional contraband; as is also coal. By Art. 28
of the Declaration, raw cotton was enumerated among the articles
which cannot be declared contraband of war.</p>

<p>The suggestion in the letter of February 20, 1904, that certain
words quoted from the Japanese instructions had been mistransmitted
<span class="newpage"><a name="page149" id="page149">[149]</a></span>or misquoted was borne out by the Regulations governing captures at
sea, issued on March 15, 1904, Art. 14 of which announces that certain
goods are contraband &quot;in case they are destined to the enemy's army
or navy, or in case they are destined to the enemy's territory, and from
the landing place it can be inferred that they are intended for military
purposes.&quot;</p>

<p>The letters of March 10 and 15, 1905, will sufficiently explain themselves.
The accuracy of the statements contained in them was vouched
for by Baron Suyematsu, in a letter which appeared in <i>The Times</i> for
March 16, to the effect that: &quot;In Japan the matters relating to the
organisation and procedure of the prize court, and the matters relating
to prize, contraband goods, &amp;c., are regulated by two separate sets of
laws.... The so-called prize Court law of August 20, 1894, and amendment
dated March 1, 1904, which your correspondent refers to, are the
provisions relating to the former matters. The rules regulating the
latter matters&mdash;<i>viz.</i> prize, contraband goods, &amp;c., are not comprised
in them. The rules which relate to the latter matters, as existing at
present, are consolidated and comprised in an enactment which was
issued on March 7, 1904.... Under the circumstances I can only
repeat what Professor Holland says ... in other words, I fully concur
with the views taken by the Professor.&quot;</p>

<p>The distinction between articles which are &quot;absolutely contraband,&quot;
those which are &quot;conditionally contraband,&quot; and those which are
incapable of being declared contraband was expressly adopted in
Arts. 22, 24, and 28 of the unratified Declaration of London of 1909,
as to which, see the comment at the end of this section, as also the
whole of Section 10.</p></div>


<p class="lettertitle"><a name="IS-COAL-CONTRABAND-OF-WAR" />IS COAL CONTRABAND OF WAR?</p>

<p>Sir,&mdash;This question has now been answered, in unmistakable
terms, on behalf of this country by Lord Lansdowne
in his reply, which you printed yesterday, to Messrs. Powley,
Thomas, and Co., and on behalf of Japan by the proclamation
which appears in <i>The Times</i> of to-day. Both of these
documents set forth the old British doctrine, now fully
adopted in the United States, and beginning to win its way
on the Continent of Europe, that, besides articles which are
absolutely contraband, other articles <i>ancipitis usus</i>, and
amongst them coal, may become so under certain conditions.
&quot;When destined,&quot; says Lord Lansdowne, &quot;for warlike as
opposed to industrial use.&quot; &quot;When destined,&quot; says Japan,<span class="newpage"><a name="page150" id="page150">[150]</a></span>
&quot;for the enemy's army or navy, or in such cases where, <i>being
goods arriving, at enemy's territory</i>, there is reason to believe
that they are intended for use of enemy's army or navy.&quot;</p>

<p>I may say that the words which I have italicised must, I
think, have been mistranslated or mistransmitted. Their
intention is, doubtless, substantially that which was more
clearly expressed in the Japanese proclamation of 1894 by
the words: &quot;Either the enemy's fleet at sea or a hostile port
used exclusively or mainly for naval or military equipment.&quot;</p>

<p>A phrase in your issue of to-day with reference to the
Cardiff coal trade suggests that it may be worth while to
touch upon the existence of a widely-spread confusion
between the grounds on which export of coal may be prohibited
by a neutral country and those which justify its confiscation,
although on board a neutral ship, by a belligerent.
A neutral State restrains, under certain circumstances, the
export of coal, not because coal is contraband, but because
such export is converting the neutral territory into a base of
belligerent operations. The question of contraband or no
contraband only arises between the neutral carrier and the
belligerent when the latter claims to be entitled to interfere
with the trade of the former.</p>

<p>Since the rules applicable to the carriage of coal are, I
venture to think, equally applicable, to the carriage of foodstuffs,
I may perhaps be allowed to add a few words with
reference to the letter addressed to you a day or two ago by
Sir Henry Bliss. I share his desire for some explanation of
the telegram which reached you on the 12th of this month
from British Columbia. One would like to know: (1) What
is &quot;the Government,&quot; if any, which has instructed the
Empress Line not to forward foodstuffs to Japan; (2)
whether the refusal relates to foodstuffs generally, or only to
those with a destination for warlike use; (3) what is meant
by the statement that &quot;the steamers of the Empress Line
belong to the Naval Reserve&quot;? I presume the meaning to
be that the line is subsidised with a view to the employment
<span class="newpage"><a name="page151" id="page151">[151]</a></span>of the ships of the company as British cruisers when Great
Britain is at war. The bearing of this fact upon the employment
of the ships when Great Britain is at peace is far from
apparent. It is, of course, possible that the Government
contract with the company may have been so drawn, <i>ex
abundanti cautela</i>, as greatly to restrict what would otherwise
have been the legitimate trade of the company.</p>

<p class="lettertitle"><a name="COTTON-AS-CONTRABAND-OF-WAR-1905" />COTTON AS CONTRABAND OF WAR</p>

<p>Sir,&mdash;The text of the decision of the Court of Appeal at
St. Petersburg in the case of the <i>Calchas</i> has at length reached
this country, and we are thus informed, upon the highest
authority, though, perhaps, not in the clearest language, of
the meaning which is now to be placed upon the Russian
notification that cotton is contraband of war.</p>

<p>This notification, promulgated on April 21, 1904, was
received with general amazement, not diminished by an
official gloss to the effect that it &quot;applied only to raw cotton
suitable for the manufacture of explosives, and not to yarn
or tissues.&quot; It must be remembered that at the date mentioned,
and for some months afterwards, Russia stoutly
maintained that all the articles enumerated in her list of contraband
of February 28, 1904, and in the additions to that
list, were &quot;absolutely&quot; such; <i>i.e.</i> were confiscable if in
course of carriage to any enemy's port, irrespectively of the
character of that port, or of the use to which the articles
would probably be put. It was only after much correspondence,
and the receipt of strong protests from Great
Britain and the United States, that Russia consented to
recognise the well-known distinction between &quot;absolute&quot;
and &quot;conditional&quot; contraband; the latter class consisting
of articles useful in peace as well as for war, the character
of which must, therefore, depend upon whether they are, in
<span class="newpage"><a name="page152" id="page152">[152]</a></span>point of fact, destined for warlike or for peaceful uses. This
concession was made about the middle of September last,
and it was then agreed that provisions should be placed in
the secondary category (as was duly explained in the Petersburg
judgment in the case of the <i>Arabia</i> on December 14)
together with some other articles, among which it seemed
that raw cotton was not included.</p>

<p>The final decision in the <i>Calchas</i> case marks a welcome
change of policy. Cotton has now followed foodstuffs into
the category of &quot;conditional&quot; contraband, and effect has so
far been given to the representations on the subject made by
Mr. Hay in circular despatches of June 10 and August 30,
1904, and by Sir Charles Hardinge, in a note presented to
Count Lamsdorff on October 9 of the same year.</p>

<p>The question had become a practical one in the case of
the <i>Calchas</i>. On July 25 this vessel, laden with, <i>inter alia</i>,
nine tons of raw cotton for Yokohama and Kobe, was seized
by a Russian cruiser and carried into Vladivostok, where,
on September 18, the cotton, together with other portions of
her cargo, was condemned as absolutely contraband. The
reasons for repudiating this decision, and the notification to
which it gave effect, were not far to seek, and it may still be
worth while to insist upon them. As against Russia, it is
well to recall that, from the days of the Armed Neutralities
onwards, her traditional policy has been to favour a very
restricted list of contraband; that when in 1877, as again in
1900 and 1904, she included in it materials &quot;servant de faire
sauter les obstacles,&quot; the examples given of such materials
were things so immediately fitted for warlike use as &quot;les
mines, les torpilles, la dynamite,&quot; &amp;c.; and that what is
said as to &quot;conditional contraband&quot; by her trusted adviser,
Professor de Martens, in his <i>Droit International</i>, t. iii (1887),
pp. 351-354, can scarcely be reconciled with her recent action.</p>

<p>But a still stronger argument against the inclusion of
cotton in the list of &quot;absolute&quot; contraband is that this is
wholly without precedent. It has, indeed, been alleged that
<span class="newpage"><a name="page153" id="page153">[153]</a></span>cotton was declared to be &quot;contraband&quot; by the United
States in their Civil War. The Federal proclamations will,
however, be searched in vain for anything of the kind. The
mistake is due to an occasional loose employment of the
term, as descriptive of articles found by an invader in an
enemy's territory, which, although the property of private,
and even neutral, individuals, happen to be so useful for the
purposes of the war as to be justly confiscated. That this
was so will appear from an attentive reading of the case of
<i>Mrs. Alexander's Cotton</i>, in 1861 (2 Wallace, 404), and of the
arguments in the claim made by Messrs. Maza and Larrache
against the United States in 1886 (Foreign Relations of U.S.,
1887). A similarly loose use of the term was its application
by General B.F. Butler to runaway slaves who had been
employed on military works&mdash;an application of which he
confessed himself &quot;never very proud as a lawyer,&quot; though
&quot;as an executive officer, much comforted with it.&quot; The
phrase caught the popular fancy, came to be applied to
slaves generally, and was immortalised in a song, long a
favourite among negro children, the refrain of which was
&quot;I'se a happy little contraband.&quot;</p>

<p>The decision of the Court of St. Petersburg in the case of
the <i>Calchas</i>, so far as it recognises the existence of a conditional
class of contraband, and that raw cotton, as <i>res
ancipitis usus</i>, must be treated in accordance with the rules
applicable to goods belonging to that class, has laid down an
unimpeachable proposition of law. Whether the view taken
by the Court of the facts of the case, so far as they relate to
the cotton cargo, is equally satisfactory, is a different and
less important question, upon which I refrain from troubling
you upon the present occasion.</p>

<p>P.S.&mdash;It may be worth while to add, for the benefit of
those only who care to be provided with a clue (not to be
<span class="newpage"><a name="page154" id="page154">[154]</a></span>found in the judgment) through the somewhat labyrinthine
details of the question under discussion, a summary of its
history. The Russian rules as to contraband are contained
in several documents&mdash;<i>viz.</i> the &quot;Regulations as to Naval
Prize&quot; of 1895, Arts. 11-14; the &quot;Admiralty Instructions&quot;
of 1900, Arts. 97, 98, and the appended &quot;Special Declaration&quot;
as to the articles considered to be contraband (partly
modelled on the list of 1877); the &quot;Imperial Order&quot; of
February 28, 1904, rule 6 (this Order keeps alive the rules
of 1895 and 1900, except in so far as they are varied by it);
the &quot;Order&quot; of March 19, 1904, defining &quot;food&quot; and
bringing machinery of certain kinds into the list of contraband;
the &quot;Order,&quot; of April 21, 1904, bringing &quot;raw
cotton&quot; into the list; and, lastly, the &quot;Instructions&quot; of
September 30 and October 28, 1904, recognising, in effect,
a class of &quot;conditional&quot; contraband, placing foodstuffs
in this class, as also, ultimately, other objects &quot;capable of
warlike use and not specified in sections 1-9 of rule 6.&quot;</p>

<p>Sir,&mdash;Your correspondent &quot;Judex&quot; will rejoice, as
I do, that cotton has now been declared to be &quot;absolute
contraband.&quot; May I, however, suggest that the topic
should be discussed without any reference to the fortunately
unratified Declaration of London, that premature attempt
to codify the law of maritime warfare, claiming, misleadingly,
that its rules &quot;correspond in substance with the generally
recognised principles of international law&quot;?</p>

<p>It is surely regrettable that, by the Order in Council
of August 20, 1914, our Government adopted the provisions
of the Declaration &quot;during the present hostilities,&quot; and
&quot;subject to various additions and modifications,&quot; the
list of which has since been considerably extended. This
<span class="newpage"><a name="page155" id="page155">[155]</a></span>half-hearted course of action painfully recalls certain vicious
methods of legislation by reference, and was additionally
uncalled for, since, as has been shown by recent events,
about two-thirds of the rules laid down by the Declaration
are inapplicable to modern warfare.</p>

<p>The straightforward announcement made by the United
States in their Note of January 25 is surely far preferable.
It states in plain terms that, &quot;As the Declaration of London
is not in force, the rules of international law only apply.
As to articles to be regarded as contraband there is no
general agreement between nations.&quot; In point of fact,
the hard-and-fast categories of neutral imports, suggested
by the threefold Grotian division, as set forth in the Declaration,
are unlikely ever to be generally accepted. Even
Grotius is careful to limit his proposals, and Bynkershoek,
in commenting upon them, points out that the test of
contraband of the most noxious kind must be the, possibly
exceptional, importance of objects for hostile use; their
being of use also for non-hostile purposes being immaterial
(&quot;nec interesse an et extra bellum usum praebeant&quot;). The
application of these remarks to the case of cotton is
sufficiently obvious.</p>

<p class="lettertitle"><a name="JAPANESE-PRIZE-LAW-1905" />JAPANESE PRIZE LAW</p>

<p>Sir,&mdash;I hope you will allow me space for a few words
with reference to some statements occurring to-day in your
Marine Insurance news which I venture to think are of a
misleading character.</p>

<p>Your Correspondent observes that&mdash;</p>

<div class="letterquot"><p>&quot;Although the Japanese are signatories to the Treaty of Paris, it
should not be forgotten that they haw a Prize Court Law of their own
(August 20, 1894), and are more likely to follow its provisions, in
<span class="newpage"><a name="page156" id="page156">[156]</a></span>dealing with the various captured steamers, than the general principles
of the Treaty of Paris.&quot;</p></div>

<p>Upon this paragraph let me remark:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. The action of the Japanese is in full accordance with
the letter and spirit of all four articles of the Declaration of
Paris. (&quot;The Treaty of Paris&quot; has, of course, no bearing
upon prize law.)</p>

<p>2. &quot;The general principles&quot; of that Declaration is a
phrase which conveys to me, I confess, no meaning.</p>

<p>3. The Japanese have, of course, a prize law of their
own, borrowed, for the most part, from our own Admiralty
Manual of Prize Law. Neither the British nor the
Japanese instructions are in conflict with, or indeed stand
in any relation to, the Declaration of Paris.</p>

<p>4. The existing prize law of Japan was promulgated on
March 7, 1904, not on August 20, 1894.</p>

<p>Your Correspondent goes on to say that the Japanese
definition of contraband &quot;is almost as sweeping as was the
Russian definition, to which the British Government took
active objection last summer.&quot; So far is this from being
the case that the Japanese list is practically the same as
our own, both systems recognising the distinction between
&quot;absolute&quot; and &quot;conditional&quot; contraband, which, till the
other day, was ignored by Russia.</p>

<p>The Japanese rules as to the cases in which ships carrying
contraband may be confiscated are quite reasonable and in
accordance with British views. The third ground for confiscation
mentioned by your Correspondent does not occur
in the instructions of 1904.</p>

<p>Ships violating a blockade are, of course, confiscable;
but the Japanese do not, as your Correspondent seems to
have been informed, make the existence of a blockade conditional
upon its having been &quot;notified to the Consuls of
all States in the blockaded port.&quot; Commanders are, no
doubt, instructed to notify the fact, &quot;as far as possible,
to the competent authorities and the Consuls of the neutral<span class="newpage"><a name="page157" id="page157">[157]</a></span>
Powers within the circumference of the blockade&quot;; but
that is a very different thing.</p>

<p>Sir,&mdash;Let me assure your correspondent upon Marine
Insurance that I have been familiar, ever since its promulgation,
with the Japanese prize law of 1894, quoted by him as
authority for statements made in your issue of March 10,
the misleading character of which I felt bound to point out
in a letter of the same date. All the topics mentioned by
him on that occasion, and to-day, are, however, regulated,
not by that law, but by notifications and instructions issued
from time to time during 1904.</p>

<p>I make it my business not only to be authoritatively informed
on such matters, but also to see that my information
is up to date.</p>

<p class="subsectionhead">(Continuous Voyages)</p>

<div class="intronotes"><p>The opinion expressed in the letter which immediately follows,
that the American decisions, applying to carriage of contraband the
doctrine of &quot;continuous voyages,&quot; seem to be &quot;demanded by the
conditions of modern commerce, and might well be followed by a
British prize Court,&quot; was referred to by Lord Salisbury in a despatch
of January 10, 1900, to be communicated to Count von B&uuml;low, with
reference to the seizure of <i>Bundesrath</i>. <i>Parl. Papers</i>, Africa, No. 1
(1900), p. 19.</p>

<p>The distinction, drawn in the same letter, between &quot;carriage of
contraband&quot; and &quot;enemy service,&quot; which has sometimes been lost
sight of, was established in the case of <i>Yangtsze Insurance Association</i>
v. <i>Indemnity Mutual Marine Company</i>, [1908] K.B. 910, in which it
was held by Bigham, J., that the transport of military officers of a
belligerent State, as passengers in a neutral ship, is not a breach or a
warranty against contraband of war in a policy of marine insurance.<span class="newpage"><a name="page158" id="page158">[158]</a></span>
The carriage of enemy despatches will no longer be generally treated
as &quot;enemy service&quot; since The Hague Convention, No. xi. of 1907,
ratified by most of the Powers, including Great Britain, on November
27, 1909, by Art. 1 provides that, except in the case of breach of blockade,
&quot;the postal correspondence of neutrals or <i>belligerents</i>, whether of <i>an
official</i> or a private character, found on board a <i>neutral</i> or enemy
ship on the High Seas is inviolable.&quot;</p>

<p>The case of the <i>Allanton</i>, which gave occasion for the letter of
July 11, 1904, was as follows. This British ship left Cardiff on February 24
of that year, with a cargo of coal to be delivered either at Hong-Kong
or Sasebo. On arrival at Hong-Kong, she found orders to deliver at
Sasebo, and, having made delivery accordingly, was chartered by a
Japanese company at another Japanese port, to carry coal to a British
firm at Singapore. On her way thither, she was captured by a Russian
squadron and taken in to Vladivostok, where on June 24 she was
condemned by the prize Court for carriage of contraband. The Court
held, ignoring the rule that a vessel ceases to be <i>in dilecto</i> when she
has &quot;deposited&quot; her contraband (since affirmed by Art. 38 of the
Declaration of London of 1909), that she was liable in respect of her
voyage to Sasebo; as also in respect of the voyage on which she was
captured, on the ground that her real destination was at that time the
Japanese fleet, or some Japanese port. This decision was reversed,
as to both ship and cargo, by the Court of Appeal at St. Petersburg, on
October 22 of the same year.</p>

<p>The doctrine of &quot;continuous voyages&quot; was by the Declaration
of London, Art. 30, recognised in the case of &quot;absolute,&quot; but by
Art. 35 was stated to be inapplicable to the case of &quot;conditional&quot;
contraband.</p></div>


<p class="lettertitle"><a name="PRIZE-LAW" />PRIZE LAW</p>

<p>Sir,&mdash;Questions of maritime international law which
are likely to give rise not only to forensic argument in
the prize Courts which we have established at Durban
and at the Cape, but also to diplomatic communications
between Great Britain and neutral Governments, should
obviously be handled just now with a large measure of
reserve. Lord Rosebery has, however, in your columns
called upon our Government to define its policy with reference
to foodstuffs as contraband of war, while several other
correspondents have touched upon, cognate topics. You
may perhaps therefore be disposed to allow one who is
<span class="newpage"><a name="page159" id="page159">[159]</a></span>responsible for the <i>Admiralty Manual of the Law of Prize</i>, to
which reference has been made by your correspondent &quot;S.,&quot;
to make a few statements as to points upon which it may
be desirable for the general reader to be in possession of
information accurate, one may venture to hope, as far
as it goes.</p>

<p>Of the four inconveniences to which neutral trading
vessels are liable in time of war, &quot;blockade&quot; may be left
out of present consideration. You can only blockade the
ports of your enemy, and the South African Republics have
no port of their own. The three other inconveniences must,
however, all be endured&mdash;<i>viz.</i> prohibition to carry &quot;contraband,&quot;
prohibition to engage in &quot;enemy service,&quot; and
liability to be &quot;visited and searched&quot; anywhere except
within three miles of a neutral coast, in order that it may be
ascertained whether they are disregarding either of these
prohibitions, as to the meaning of which some explanation
may not be superfluous.</p>

<p>1. &quot;Carriage of contraband&quot; implies (1) that the goods
carried are fit for hostile use; (2) that they are on their way
to a hostile destination. Each of these requirements has
given rise to wide divergence of views and to a considerable
literature. As to (1), while Continental opinion and practice
favour a hard-and-fast list of contraband articles, comprising
only such as are already suited, or can readily be adapted,
for use in operations of war, English and American opinion
and practice favour a longer list, and one capable of being
from time to time extended to meet the special exigencies
of the war. In such a list may figure even provisions,
&quot;under circumstances arising out of the particular situation
of the war,&quot; especially if &quot;going with a highly probable
destination to military use&quot;&mdash;Lord Stowell in the <i>Jonge
Margaretha</i> (1 Rob. 188); <i>cf.</i> Story, J., in the <i>Commercen</i>
(1 Wheat. 382), the date and purport of which are, by the
by, incorrectly given by &quot;S.&quot; It would be in accordance
with our own previous practice and with Lord Granville's
<span class="newpage"><a name="page160" id="page160">[160]</a></span>despatches during the war between France and China in
1885, if we treated flour as contraband only when ear-marked
as destined for the use of enemy fleets, armies, or fortresses.
Even in such cases our practice has been not to confiscate
the cargo, but merely to exercise over it a right of &quot;pre-emption,&quot;
so as to deprive the enemy of its use without
doing more injury than can be helped to neutral trade&mdash;as
is explained by Lord Stowell in the <i>Haabet</i> (2 Rob. 174).
As to (2), the rule was expressed by Lord Stowell to be that
&quot;goods going to a neutral port cannot come under the
description of contraband, all goods going there being equally
lawful&quot;&mdash;<i>Imina</i> (3 Rob. 167); but innovations were made
upon this rule during the American Civil War which seem
to be demanded by the conditions of modern commerce,
and might well be followed by a British prize Court. It
was held that contraband goods, although <i>bona fide</i> on their
way to a neutral port, might be condemned, if intended
afterwards to reach the enemy by another ship or even by
means of land carriage&mdash;<i>Bermuda</i> (3 Wallace); <i>Peterhoff</i>
(5 Wallace). A consignment to Lorenzo Marques, connected
as is the town by only forty miles of railway with the Transvaal
frontier, would seem to be well within the principles
of the Civil War cases as to &quot;continuous voyages.&quot;</p>

<p>2. The carriage by a neutral ship of enemy troops, or of
even a few military officers, as also of enemy despatches, is
an &quot;enemy service&quot; of so important a kind as to involve
the confiscation of the vessel concerned, a penalty which,
under ordinary circumstances, is not imposed upon carriage
of &quot;contraband&quot; property so called. See Lord Stowell's
luminous judgments in <i>Orozembo</i> (6 Rob. 430) and <i>Atalanta</i>
(<i>ib.</i> 440). The alleged offence of the ship <i>Bundesrath</i> would
seem to be of this description.</p>

<p>The questions, both of &quot;contraband&quot; and of &quot;enemy
service,&quot; with which our prize Courts must before long have
to deal, will be such as to demand from the Judges a competent
knowledge of the law of prize, scrupulous fairness
<span class="newpage"><a name="page161" id="page161">[161]</a></span>towards neutral claimants, and prompt penetration of the
Protean disguises which illicit trade so readily assumes in
time of war.</p>

<p class="lettertitle"><a name="THE-ALLANTON-A" />THE <i>ALLANTON (Continuous Voyage)</i></p>

<p>Sir,&mdash;I venture to think that the letter which you
print this morning from my friend Dr. Baty, with reference
to the steamship <i>Allanton</i>, calls for a word of warning;
unless, indeed, it is to be taken as merely expressing the
private opinion of the writer as to what would be a desirable
rule of law.</p>

<p>It would be disastrous if shipowners and insurers were
to assume, that a neutral vessel, if destined for a neutral
port, is necessarily safe from capture. Words at any rate
capable of this construction may, no doubt, be quoted
from one of Lord Stowell's judgments, now more than a
century old; but many things have happened, notably
the invention of railways, since the days of that great
Judge. The United States cases, decided in the sixties
(as Dr. Baty thinks, &quot;on a demonstrably false analogy&quot;),
in which certain ships were held to be engaged in the carriage
of contraband, although their destination was a neutral
port, were substantially approved of by Great Britain.
Their principle wast adopted by Italy, in the <i>Doelwijk</i>,
in 1896, and was supported by Great Britain in the correspondence
upon this subject which took place with Germany
in 1900. It was endorsed, after prolonged discussion, by
the Institut de Droit International in 1896.</p>

<p class="subsectionhead">(Unqualified Captors)</p>

<div class="intronotes"><p>Among the objections raised by the British Government to the
capture by the Russian ship <i>Peterburg</i> in the Red Sea, on July 13, 1904,
of the P. and O. ss. <i>Malacca</i>, for carriage of contraband were (1) that
the so-called contraband consisted of government ammunition for the
use of the British fleet in Chinese waters; and (2) what was more serious,
that the capturing vessel, which belonged to the Russian volunteer fleet,
after issuing from the Black Sea under the commercial flag had subsequently,
and without touching at any Russian port, brought up guns
from her hold, and had proceeded to exercise belligerent rights under
the Russian naval flag. In consequence of the protest of the British
Government, and to close the incident, the <i>Malacca</i> was released at
Algiers, after a purely formal examination, on July 27, and Russia
agreed to instruct the officers of her volunteer fleet not to make any
similar captures.</p>

<p>The question of the legitimacy of the transformation on the high
seas into a ship-of-war of a vessel which has previously been sailing under
the commercial flag was much discussed at The Hague Conference of
1907, but without result. Opinions were so much divided upon the
point, that no mention of it is made in Convention No. vii. of that year,
ratified by Great Britain on November 27, 1909, &quot;as to the transformation
of merchant vessels into ships-of-war.&quot; At the session
of the Institut de Droit International held at Oxford in 1913, this
question was discussed, and rules relating to it will be found in
Section 2 of the <i>Manuel des lois de la guerre maritime</i>, the drafting
of which occupied the whole of the session.</p></div>


<p class="lettertitle"><a name="THE-ALLANTON-B" />THE <i>ALLANTON (Unqualified Captors)</i></p>

<p>Sir,&mdash;The indignation caused by the treatment of the
<i>Allanton</i> is natural, and will almost certainly prove to be
well founded; but Mr. Rae, in the letter which you print
this morning, overstates a good case. He asks that,
&quot;whatever steps are taken for the release of the <i>Malacca</i>,
equally strong steps should be taken for the release of the
<i>Allanton</i>&quot;; and he can see no difference between the cases
of the two ships, except that the former is owned by a
powerful company in the habit of carrying British mails,
while the latter is his private property.</p>

<p>One would have supposed it to be notorious that the
<span class="newpage"><a name="page163" id="page163">[163]</a></span>facts which distinguish the one case from the other are,
first, that the capture of the <i>Malacca</i> was effected by a vessel
not entitled to exercise belligerent rights; and, secondly,
that Great Britain is prepared to claim the incriminated
cargo as belonging to the British Government. Capture
by an unqualified cruiser is so sufficient a ground for a
claim of restoration and compensation that, except perhaps
as facilitating the retreat of Russia from a false position, it
would seem, to say the least, superfluous to pray in aid
any other reason for the cancellation of an act unlawful
<i>ab initio.</i></p>

<p>I have not noticed any statement as to the actual constitution
of the prize Court concerned in the condemnation
of the <i>Allanton.</i> Under Rule 54 of the Russian Naval
Regulations of 1895, a &quot;Port Prize Court&quot; must, for a
decree of confiscation, consist of six members, of whom
three must be officials of the Ministries of Marine, Justice,
and Foreign Affairs respectively. An &quot;Admirals' Prize
Court,&quot; for the same purpose, need consist of only four
members, all of whom are naval officers.</p>

<p class="subsectionhead">(Note upon the Declaration of London)</p>

<div class="intronotes"><p>The British delegates to The Hague Conference of 1907 were
instructed that H.M. Government &quot;are ready and willing for their
part, in lieu of endeavouring to frame new and more satisfactory
rules for the prevention of contraband trade in the future, to abandon
the principle of contraband of war altogether, thus allowing the oversea
trade in neutral vessels between belligerents on the one hand and
neutrals on the other, to continue during war without any restriction,&quot;
except with reference to blockades. This proposal, fortunately, was
not accepted by the Conference, which was unable even to agree upon
lists of contraband articles, and recommended that the question
should be further considered by the Governments concerned, <i>Parl.
Paper, Miscell.</i> No. 1 (1908), p. 194.</p>

<p>This task was accordingly among those undertaken at the Conference
of Maritime Powers held in London in 1908-1909, which resulted in
<span class="newpage"><a name="page164" id="page164">[164]</a></span>a Declaration, Arts. 22-44 of which constituted a fairly complete code
of the law of contraband. Reference has already been made, in comments
upon letters comprised in previous sections, to this Declaration,
the demerits and history of which are more fully dealt with in

<div class="intronotes"><p>On the views expressed in the first of the two letters which follow,
as also in the writer's British Academy paper on <i>Neutral Duties</i>, as
translated in the <i>Marine Rundschau</i>, see Professor von Martitz of
Berlin, in the <i>Transactions</i> of the International Law Association, 1907.
The Institut de Droit International has for some years past had under
its consideration questions relating to mines, and has arrived at conclusions
which will be found in its <i>Annuaire</i>, t. xxi. p. 330, t. xxii. p. 344,
t xxiii. p. 429, t. xxiv. pp. 286, 301.</p>

<p>The topic has also been dealt with in The Hague Convention,
No. viii. of 1907, ratified with a reservation, by Great Britain on November
27, 1907. By Art. 1 it is forbidden &quot;(1) to lay unanchored automatic-contact
mines, unless they are so constructed as to become
harmless one hour at most after he who has laid them has lost control
over them; (2) to lay anchored automatic-contact mines which do
not become harmless as soon as they have broken loose from their
moorings; (3) to employ torpedoes which do not become harmless
when they have missed their mark.&quot; By Art. 2, (which is, however,
not accepted by France or Germany) it is forbidden &quot;to lay automatic-contact
mines off the coast and ports of an enemy, with the sole object
of intercepting commercial navigation.&quot;</p></div>


<p class="lettertitle"><a name="MINES-IN-THE-OPEN-SEA" />MINES IN THE OPEN SEA</p>

<p>Sir,&mdash;The question raised in your columns by Admiral
do Horsey with reference to facts as to which we are as
yet imperfectly informed, well illustrates the perpetually
recurring conflict between belligerent and neutral interests.
They are, of course, irreconcilable, and the rights of the
respective parties can be defined only by way of compromise.
It is beyond doubt that the theoretically absolute
<span class="newpage"><a name="page165" id="page165">[165]</a></span>right of neutral ships, whether public or private, to pursue
their ordinary routes over the high sea in time of war, is
limited by the right of the belligerents to fight on those
seas a naval battle, the scene of which can be approached
by such ships only at their proper risk and peril. In such
a case the neutral has ample warning of the danger to which
he would be exposed did he not alter his intended course.
It would, however, be an entirely different affair if he
should find himself implicated in belligerent war risks, of
the existence of which it was impossible for him to be
informed, while pursuing his lawful business in waters over
which no nation pretends to exercise jurisdiction.</p>

<p>It is certain that no international usage sanctions the
employment by one belligerent against the other of mines,
or other secret contrivances, which would, without notice,
render dangerous the navigation of the high seas. No
belligerent has ever asserted a right to do anything of
the kind; and it may be in the recollection of your
readers that strong disapproval was expressed of a design,
erroneously attributed to the United States a few years
since, of effecting the blockade of certain Cuban ports by
torpedoes, instead of by a cruising squadron. These, it
was pointed out, would superadd to the risk of capture
and confiscation, to which a blockade-runner is admittedly
liable, the novel penalty of total destruction of the ship
and all on board.</p>

<p>It may be worth while to add, as bearing upon the
question under discussion, that there is a tendency in
expert opinion towards allowing the line between &quot;territorial
waters&quot; and the &quot;high seas&quot; to be drawn at a
considerably greater distance than the old measurement of
three miles from the shore.</p>

<p class="lettertitle"><a name="TERRITORIAL-WATERS" />TERRITORIAL WATERS</p>

<p>Sir,&mdash;Most authorities would, I think, agree with
Admiral de Horsey that the line between &quot;territorial
waters&quot; and &quot;the high sea&quot; is drawn by international
law, if drawn by it anywhere, at a distance of three miles
from low-water mark. In the first place, the ridiculously
wide claims made, on behalf of certain States, by medi&aelig;val
jurists were cut down by Grotius to so much water as can
be controlled from the land. The Grotian formula was
then worked out by Bynkershoek with reference to the
range of cannon; and, finally, this somewhat variable test
was before the end of the eighteenth century, as we may
see from the judgments of Lord Stowell, superseded by
the hard-and-fast rule of the three-mile limit, which has
since received ample recognition in treaties, legislation, and
judicial decisions.</p>

<p>The subordinate question, also touched upon by the
Admiral, of the character to be attributed to bays, the
entrance to which exceeds six miles in breadth, presents
more difficulty than that relating to strictly coastal waters.
I will only say that the Privy Council, in <i>The Direct U.S.
Cable Co.</i> v. <i>Anglo-American Telegraph Co.</i> (L.R. 2 App.
Ca. 394), carefully avoided giving an opinion as to the
international law applicable to such bays, but decided
the case before them, which had arisen with reference to
the Bay of Conception, in Newfoundland, on the narrow
ground that, as a British Court, they were bound by
certain assertions of jurisdiction made in British Acts of
Parliament.</p>

<p>The three-mile distance has, no doubt, become inadequate
in consequence of the increased range of modern
cannon, but no other can be substituted for it without
express agreement of the Powers. One can hardly admit
the view which has been maintained, <i>e.g.</i> by Professor de
Martens, that the distance shifts automatically in accord<span class="newpage"><a name="page167" id="page167">[167]</a></span>ance
with improvements in artillery. The whole matter
might well be included among the questions relating to
the rights and duties of neutrals, for the consideration of
which by a conference, to be called at an early date, a
wish was recorded by The Hague Conference, of 1899.</p>

<p>In the meantime it may be worth while to call attention
to the view of the subject taken by a specially qualified and
representative body of international experts. The Institut
de Droit International, after discussions and enquiries which
had lasted for several years, adopted, at their Paris meeting
in 1894, the following resolutions, as a statement of
what, in the opinion of the Institut, would be reasonable
rules with reference to territorial waters (I cite only those
bearing upon the extent of such waters):&mdash;</p>

<div class="letterquot"><p>&quot;Art. 2.&mdash;La mer territoriale s'&eacute;tend &agrave; six milles marins (60 au
degr&eacute; de latitude) de la laisse de basse mar&eacute;e sur tout l'&eacute;tendue des
c&ocirc;tes. Art. 3.&mdash;Pour les baies, la mer territoriale suit les sinuosit&eacute;s de la
c&ocirc;te, sauf qu'elle mesur&eacute;e &agrave; partir d'une ligne droite tir&eacute;e en travers
de la baie, dans la partie la plus rapproch&eacute;e de l'ouverture vers la mer,
o&ugrave; l'&eacute;cart entre les deux c&ocirc;tes de la baie est de douze milles marins
de largeur, &agrave; moins qu'un usage continu et s&eacute;culaire n'ait consacr&eacute;
une largeur plus grande. Art. 4.&mdash;En cas de guerre, l'&eacute;tat riverain
neutre a le droit de fixer, par la d&eacute;claration de neutralit&eacute;, ou par
notification sp&eacute;ciale, sa zone neutre au dela de six milles, jusqu'&agrave;
port&eacute;e du canon des c&ocirc;tes. Art. 5.&mdash;Tous les navires sans distinction
ont le droit de passage inoffensif par la mer territoriale, sauf le droit
des bellig&eacute;rants de r&egrave;glementer et, dans un but de d&eacute;fense, de barrer le
passage dans la dite mer pour tout navire, et sauf le droit de neutres
de r&egrave;glementer le passage dans la dite mer pour les navires de guerre
de toutes nationalit&eacute;s.&quot; (<i>Annuaire de l'Institut</i>, t. xiii. p. 329).</p></div>

<div class="intronotes"><p>With the letters which follow, compare the article by the present
writer on &quot;Les cables sous-marins en temps de guerre,&quot; in the <i>Journal
de Droit International Priv&eacute;</i>, 1898, p. 648.</p>

<p>The topic of cable-cutting, as to which the Institut de Droit International
arrived in 1879 at the conclusions set out in the first of these
letters, was again taken into consideration by the Institut in 1902: see
the <i>Annuaire</i> for that year, pp. 301-332.</p>

<p>The Hague Convention; No. iv. of 1907, provides, in Art. 54, that
&quot;submarine cables connecting occupied territory with a neutral
territory shall not be destroyed or seized, unless in case of absolute
necessity. They must be restored, and compensation must be arranged
for them at the peace.&quot;</p>

<p>Convention No. v., by Art. 3, forbids belligerents (1) to install
on neutral territory a radio-telegraphic station, or any other apparatus,
for communicating with their land or sea forces; (2) to employ such
apparatus, established by them there before the war, for purely military
purposes. By Art. 5, a neutral Power is bound to permit nothing of
the sort.</p></div>


<p class="lettertitle"><a name="SUBMARINE-CABLES" />SUBMARINE CABLES</p>

<p>Sir,&mdash;The possibility of giving some legal protection
to submarine cables has been carefully considered by the
Institut de Droit International. A committee was appointed
in 1878 to consider the subject, and the presentation of its
report to the meeting at Brussels in 1879 was followed
by an interesting discussion (see the <i>Annuaire de l'Institut</i>,
1879-80, pp. 351-394). The conclusions ultimately adopted
by the Institut were as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="letterquot"><p>&quot;1. It would be very useful if the various States would come
to an understanding to declare that destruction of, or injury to, submarine
cables in the high seas is an offence under the Law of Nations,
and to fix precisely the wrongful character of the acts, and the appropriate
penalties. With reference to the last-mentioned point, the
degree of uniformity attainable must depend on the amount of difference
between systems of criminal legislation. The right of arresting offenders,
or those presumed to be such, might be given to the public vessels
of all nations, under conditions regulated by treaties, but the right to
try them should be reserved to the national Courts of the vessel arrested.</p>

<p>&quot;2. A submarine-telegraph cable uniting two neutral territories
<span class="newpage"><a name="page169" id="page169">[169]</a></span>is inviolable. It is desirable that, when telegraphic communication
must be interrupted in consequence of war, a belligerent should confine
himself to such measures as are absolutely necessary to prevent the
cable from being used, and that such measures should be discontinued,
or that any damage caused by them, should be repaired as soon as the
cessation of hostilities may permit.&quot;</p></div>

<p>Sir,&mdash;I venture to think that the question which has
been raised as to the legitimacy of cable-cutting is not so
insoluble as most of the allusions to it might lead one to
suppose. It is true that no light is thrown upon it by the
Convention of 1884, which relates exclusively to time of
peace, and was indeed signed by Lord Lyons, on behalf
of Great Britain, only with an express reservation to that
effect. Nor are we helped by the case to which attention
was called in your columns some time since by Messrs.
Eyre and Spottiswoode. Their allusion was doubtless to
the <i>International</i> (L.R. 3 A. and E. 321), which is irrelevant
to the present enquiry. The question is a new one, but,
though covered by no precedent, I cannot doubt that it
is covered by certain well-established principles of international
law, which, it is hardly necessary to remark, is no
cut-and-dried system but a body of rules founded upon, and
moving with, the public opinion of nations.</p>

<p>That branch of international law which deals with the
relations of neutrals and belligerents is, of course, a compromise
between what Grotius calls the &quot;belli rigor&quot; and the
&quot;commerciorum libertas.&quot; The terms of the compromise,
originally suggested partly by equity, partly by national
interest, have been varied and re-defined, from time to
time, with reference to the same considerations. It is perhaps
reasonable that, in settling these terms, preponderant
<span class="newpage"><a name="page170" id="page170">[170]</a></span>weight should have been given to the requirements of belligerents,
engaged possibly in a life-and-death struggle. &quot;Ius
commerciorum &aelig;quum est,&quot; says Gentili; &quot;at hoc &aelig;quius,
tuend&aelig; salutis.&quot; There is accordingly no doubt that in
land warfare a belligerent may not only interrupt communications
by road, railway, post, or telegraph without giving
any ground of complaint to neutrals who may be thereby
inconvenienced, but may also lay hands on such neutral
property&mdash;shipping, railway carriages, or telegraphic plant&mdash;as
may be essential to the conduct of his operations, making
use of and even destroying it, subject only to a duty to
compensate the owners. This he does in pursuance of the
well-known &quot;droit d'angarie,&quot; an extreme application of
which occurred in 1871, when certain British colliers were
sunk in the Seine by the Prussians in order to prevent the
passage of French gunboats up the river. Count Bismarck
undertook that the owners of the ships should be indemnified,
and Lord Granville did not press for anything further.
Such action, if it took place outside of belligerent territory,
would not be tolerated for a moment.</p>

<p>The application of these principles to the case of submarine
cables would appear to be, to a certain point at any
rate, perfectly clear. Telegraphic communication with the
outside world may well be as important to a State engaged
in warfare as similar means of communication between
one point and another within its own territory. Just as an
invader would without scruple interrupt messages, and even
destroy telegraphic plant, on land, so may he thus act
within the enemy's territorial waters, or, perhaps, even so
far from shore as he could reasonably place a blockading
squadron. It may be objected that a belligerent has no
right to prevent the access of neutral ships to unblockaded
portions of the enemy's coast on the ground that by carrying
diplomatic agents or despatches they are keeping up the
communications of his enemy with neutral Governments.
But this indulgence rests on the presumption that such
<span class="newpage"><a name="page171" id="page171">[171]</a></span>official communications are &quot;innocent,&quot; a presumption
obviously inapplicable to telegraphic messages indiscriminately
received in the course of business. It would seem,
therefore, to be as reasonable as it is in accordance with
analogy, that a belligerent should be allowed, within the
territorial waters of his enemy, to cut a cable, even though it
may be neutral property, of which the <i>terminus ad quem</i> is
enemy territory, subject only to a liability to indemnify
the neutral owners.</p>

<p>The cutting, elsewhere than in the enemy's waters, of
a cable connecting enemy with neutral territory receives
no countenance from international law. Still less permissible
would be the cutting of a cable connecting two
neutral ports, although messages may pass through it which,
by previous and subsequent stages of transmission, may
be useful to the enemy.</p>

<p class="lettertitle"><a name="SUBMARINE-CABLES-IN-TIME-OF-WAR-B" />SUBMARINE CABLES IN TIME OF WAR</p>

<p>Sir,&mdash;Will you allow me to refer in a few words to the
interesting letters upon the subject of submarine cables
which have been addressed to you by Mr. Parson&eacute; and
Mr. Charles Bright? In asserting that &quot;the question as to
the legitimacy of cable-cutting is covered by no precedent,&quot;
I had no intention of denying that belligerent interference
with cables had ever occurred. International precedents
are made by diplomatic action (or deliberate inaction) with
reference to facts, not by those facts themselves. To the
best of my belief no case of cable-cutting has ever been
made matter of diplomatic representation, and I understand
Mr. Parson&eacute; to admit that no claim in respect of
damage to cables was presented to the mixed Commission
appointed under the Convention of 1883 between Great
Britain and Chile.<span class="newpage"><a name="page172" id="page172">[172]</a></span></p>

<p>In the course of his able address upon &quot;Belligerents
and Neutrals,&quot; reported in your issue of this morning, I
observe that Mr. Macdonell suggests that the Institut de
Droit International might usefully study the question of
cables in time of war. It may, therefore, be well to state
that this service hat already been rendered. The Institut,
at its Paris meeting in 1878, appointed a committee, of
which M. Renault was chairman, to consider the whole
subject of the protection of cables, both in peace and in
war; and at its Brussels meeting, in 1879, carefully discussed
the exhaustive report of its committee and voted
certain &quot;conclusions,&quot; notably the following:&mdash;</p>

<div class="letterquot"><p>&quot;Le c&acirc;ble t&eacute;l&eacute;graphique sous-marin qui unit deux territoires
neutres est inviolable.</p>

<p>&quot;Il est &agrave; d&eacute;sirer, quand les communications t&eacute;l&eacute;graphiques doivent
cesser par suite de l'&eacute;tat de guerre, que l'on se borne aux mesures
strictement n&eacute;cessaires pour emp&ecirc;cher l'usage du cable, et qu'il soit mis
fin &agrave; ces mesures, ou que l'on en r&eacute;pare les consequences, aussit&ocirc;t que
le permettra la cessation des hostilit&eacute;s.&quot;</p></div>

<p>It was in no small measure due to the initiative of the
Institut that diplomatic conferences were held at Paris, which
in 1882 produced a draft convention for the protection of
cables, not restricted in its operation to time of peace; and
in 1884 the actual convention, which is so restricted.</p>

<p>It may not be generally known that in 1864, before the
difficulties of the subject were thoroughly appreciated, a
convention was signed, though it never became operative,
by which Brazil, Hayti, Italy, and Portugal undertook to
recognise the &quot;neutrality&quot; in time of war of a cable to be
laid by one Balestrini. So, in 1869, the United States were
desirous of concluding a general convention which should
assimilate the destruction of cables in the high seas to
piracy, and should continue to be in force in time of war.
The Brussels conference of 1874 avoided any mention of
&quot;c&acirc;bles sous-marins.&quot;</p>

<p>The moral of all that has been written upon this subject
is obviously that drawn by Mr. Charles Bright&mdash;<i>viz.</i> &quot;the
<span class="newpage"><a name="page173" id="page173">[173]</a></span>urgent necessity of a system of cables connecting the
British Empire by direct and independent means&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>
without touching on foreign soil.&quot;</p>

<p class="subsectionhead">Destruction of Neutral Prizes</p>

<div class="intronotes"><p>A British ship, the <i>Knight Commander</i>, bound from New York
to Yokohama and Kobe, was stopped on July 23, 1904, by a Russian
cruiser, and as her cargo consisted largely of railway material, was
considered to be engaged in carriage of contraband. Her crew and
papers were taken on board the cruiser, and she was sent to the bottom
by fire from its guns. The reasons officially given for this proceeding
were that: &quot;The proximity of the enemy's port, the lack of coal on
board the vessel to enable her to be taken into a Russian port, and the
impossibility of supplying her with coal from one of the Russian
cruisers, owing to the high seas running at the time, obliged the
commander of the Russian cruiser to sink her.&quot;</p>

<p>The Russian Regulations as to Naval Prize, Art. 21, allowed a
commander &quot;in exceptional cases, when the preservation of a captured
vessel appears impossible on account of her bad condition or entire
worthlessness, the danger of her recapture by the enemy, or the great
distance or blockade of ports, or else on account of danger threatening
the ship which has made the capture, or the success of her operations,&quot;
to burn or sink the prize.</p>

<p>The Japanese Regulations, Art. 91, were to the same effect in
cases where the prize (1) cannot be navigated owing to her being unseaworthy,
or to dangerous seas; (2) is likely to be recaptured by the
enemy; (3) cannot be navigated without depriving the ship-of-war of
officers and men required for her own safety.</p>

<p>The case of the <i>Knight Commander</i> was the subject of comment,
on the 27th of the same month, in both Houses of Parliament. In
the House of Lords, Lord Lansdowne spoke of what had occurred as
&quot;a very serious breach of international law,&quot; &quot;an outrage,&quot; against
which it had been considered &quot;a duty to lodge a strong protest.&quot; In
the House of Commons, Mr. Balfour described it as &quot;entirely contrary
to the accepted practice of civilised nations.&quot; Similar language was
used in Parliament on August 10, when Mr. Gibson Bowles alluded to
my letter of the 6th, in a way which gave occasion for that of the 14th.<span class="newpage"><a name="page174" id="page174">[174]</a></span></p>

<p>The <i>Knight Commander</i> was condemned by the Prize Court at
Vladivostok on August 16, 1904, and the sentence was confirmed on
December 5, 1905, by the Court of Appeal at St. Petersburg, which
found it &quot;impossible to agree that the destruction of a neutral vessel
is contrary to the principles of international law.&quot; The Russian
Government remained firm on the point, and in 1908 declined to submit
the case to arbitration.</p>

<p>The Institut de Droit International in its <i>Code des Prises maritimes</i>,
voted in 1887, Art. 50 (not, be it observed, professing to state the law
as it is, but as it should be), had taken a view in accordance with
that maintained by the British Government (<i>Annuaire</i> for 1888, t. ix.
p. 228; <i>cf. ib.</i> pp. 200, 201). (The <i>Manuel des lois de la guerre maritime</i>,
voted at Oxford in 1913, dealing exclusively with &quot;les rapports
entre les bellig&eacute;rants,&quot; does not deal with the topic in question.) It
was, however, the opinion of the present writer, as will appear from
the following letters, that no rule of international law, by which the
sinking of even neutral prizes was absolutely prohibited, could be shown
to exist. He had previously touched upon this question in his evidence
before the Royal Commission on the Supply of Food, &amp;c., in Time of
War, on November, 4, 1903, and returned to it later in his paper upon
&quot;The Duties of Neutrals,&quot; read to the British Academy on April 12,
1905, <i>Transactions</i>, ii. p. 66. It was reproduced in French, German,
Belgian, and Spanish periodicals, and was cited in the judgment of the
St. Petersburg Court of Appeal in the case of the <i>Knight Commander.</i></p>

<p>The subsequent history of the question, and, in particular, of the
rules suggested in Arts. 48-54 of the unratified Declaration of London,
may be claimed in favour of the correctness of the opinion maintained
in the letters.</p></div>


<p class="lettertitle"><a name="RUSSIAN-PRIZE-LAW" />RUSSIAN PRIZE LAW</p>

<p>Sir,&mdash;The neutral Powers have serious ground of complaint
as to the mode in which Russia is conducting
operations at sea. It may, however, be doubted whether
public opinion is sufficiently well informed to be capable
of estimating the comparative gravity of the acts which
are just now attracting attention. Putting aside for the
moment questions arising out of the Straits Convention of
1856, as belonging to a somewhat different order of ideas,
we may take it that the topics most needing careful consideration
relate to removal of contraband from the ship
that is carrying it without taking her in for adjudication;
<span class="newpage"><a name="page175" id="page175">[175]</a></span>interference with mail steamers and their mail bags; perversely
wrong decisions of Prize Courts; confiscation of
ships as well as of their contraband cargo; destruction of
prizes at sea; the list of contraband. Of these topics, the
two last mentioned are probably the most important, and
on each of these I will ask you to allow me to say a few
words.</p>

<p>1. There is no doubt that by the Russian regulations
of 1895, Art. 21; and instructions of 1901, Art. 40, officers
are empowered to destroy their prizes at sea, no distinction
being drawn between neutral and enemy property, under
such exceptional circumstances as the bad condition or
small value of the prize, risk of recapture, distance from a
Russian port, danger to the Imperial cruiser or to the
success of her operations. The instructions of 1901, it may
be added, explain that an officer &quot;incurs no responsibility
whatever&quot; for so acting if the captured vessel is really
liable to confiscation and the special circumstances imperatively
demand her destruction. It is fair to say that not
dissimilar, though less stringent, instructions were issued
by France in 1870 and by the United States in 1898; also
that, although the French instructions expressly contemplate
&quot;l'&eacute;tablissement des indemnit&eacute;s &agrave; attribuer aux
neutres,&quot; a French prize Court in 1870 refused compensation
to neutral owners for the loss of their property on board of
enemy ships burnt at sea.</p>

<p>The question, however, remains whether such regulations
are in accordance with the rules of international law. The
statement of these rules by Lord Stowell, who speaks of
them as &quot;clear in principle and established in practice,&quot; may,
I think, be summarised as follows: An enemy's ship, after
her crew has been placed in safety, may be destroyed.
Where there is any ground for believing that the ship, or any
part of her cargo, is neutral property, such action is justifiable
only in cases of &quot;the gravest importance to the captor's
own State,&quot; after securing the ship's papers and subject to
<span class="newpage"><a name="page176" id="page176">[176]</a></span>the right of neutral owners to receive fall compensation
(<i>Actaeon</i>, 2 Dods. 48; <i>Felicity, ib.</i> 381; substantially
followed by Dr. Lushington in the <i>Leucade</i>, Spinks, 221). It
is not the case, as is alleged by the <i>Novoe Vremya</i>, that any
British regulations &quot;contain the same provisions as the
Russian&quot; on this subject. On the contrary, the Admiralty
Manual of 1888 allows destruction of enemy vessels only;
and goes so far in the direction of liberality as to order the
release, without ransom, of a neutral prize which either from
its condition, or from lack of a prize crew, cannot be sent
in for adjudication. The Japanese instructions of 1894
permit the destruction of only enemy vessels; and Art. 50
of the carefully debated &quot;Code des prises&quot; of the Institut
de Droit International is to the same effect. It may be
worth while to add that the eminent Russian jurist, M. de
Martens, in his book on international law, published some
twenty years ago, in mentioning that the distance of her
ports from the scenes of naval operations often obliges
Russia to sink her prizes, so that &quot;ce qui les lois maritimes
de tous les &eacute;tats consid&egrave;rent comme un moyen auquel il
n'y a lieu de recourir qu'&agrave; la derni&egrave;re extr&eacute;mit&eacute;, se transformera
n&eacute;cessairement pour nous en r&egrave;gle normale,&quot; foresaw
that &quot;cette mesure d'un caract&egrave;re g&eacute;n&eacute;ral soul&eacute;vera
indubitablement contre notre pays un m&eacute;contentement
universel.&quot;</p>

<p>2. A far more important question is, I venture to think,
raised by the Russian list of contraband, sweeping, as it
does, into the category of &quot;absolutely contraband&quot; articles
things such as provisions and coal, to which a contraband
character, in any sense of the term, has usually been denied
on the Continent, while Great Britain and the United States
have admitted them into the category of &quot;conditional&quot;
contraband, only when shown to be suitable and destined for
the armed forces of the enemy, or for the relief of a place
besieged. Still more unwarrantable is the Russian claim to
interfere with the trade in raw cotton. Her prohibition of
<span class="newpage"><a name="page177" id="page177">[177]</a></span>this trade is wholly unprecedented, for the treatment of
cotton during the American Civil War will be found on
examination to have no bearing on the question under consideration.
I touch to-day upon this large subject only to
express a hope that our Government, in concert, if possible,
with other neutral Governments, has communicated to that
of Russia, with reference to its list of prohibited articles, a
protest in language as unmistakable as that employed by
our Foreign Office in 1885; &quot;I regret to have to inform
you, M. l'Ambassadeur,&quot; wrote Lord Granville, &quot;that Her
Majesty's Government feel compelled to take exception to
the proposed measure, as they cannot admit that, consistently
with the law and practice of nations, and with the
rights of neutrals, provisions in general can be treated as
contraband of war.&quot; A timely warning that a claim is
inadmissible is surely preferable to waiting till bad feeling
has been aroused by the concrete application of an objectionable
doctrine.</p>

<p>Sir,&mdash;From this hilltop I observe that, in the debate of
Thursday last, Mr. Gibson Bowles, alluding to a letter of
mine which appeared in your issue of August 6, complained
that I &quot;had not given the proper reference&quot; to Lord
Stowell's judgments. Mr. Bowles seems to be unaware that
in referring to a decided case the page mentioned is, in the
absence of any indication to the contrary, invariably that
on which the report of the case commences. I may perhaps
also be allowed to say that he, in my opinion, misapprehends
the effect of the passage quoted by him from the <i>Felicity</i>,
which decides only that, whatever may be the justification
for the destruction of a neutral prize, the neutral owner is
<span class="newpage"><a name="page178" id="page178">[178]</a></span>entitled, as against the captor, to full compensation for the
loss thereby sustained.</p>

<p class="lettertitle"><a name="RUSSIAN-PRIZE-LAW-C" />RUSSIAN PRIZE LAW</p>

<p>Sir,&mdash;Mr. Gibson Bowles has, I find, addressed to you a
letter in which he attempts to controvert two statements of
mine by the simple expedient of omitting essential portions
of each of them.</p>

<p>1. Mr. Bowles having revealed himself as unaware that
the mode in which I had cited a group of cases upon destruction
of prizes was the correct mode, I thought it well to
provide him with the rudimentary information that, &quot;in
referring to a decided case, the page, mentioned is, <i>in the
absence of any indication to the contrary</i>, invariably that on
which the report of the case commences.&quot; He replies that he
has found appended to a citation of a passage in a judgment
the page in which this passage occurs. May I refer him,
for an explanation of this phenomenon, to the words (now
italicised) omitted in his quotation of my statement? It is,
of course, common enough, when the reference is obviously
not to the case as a whole but to an extract from it, thus to
give a clue to the extract, the formula then employed being
frequently &quot;<i>at</i> page so-and-so.&quot;</p>

<p>2. I had summarised the effect, as I conceive it, of the
group of cases above mentioned in the following terms:
&quot;Such action is justifiable only in cases of the gravest importance
to the captor's own State, <i>after securing the ship's
papers, and subject to the right of the neutral owners to receive
full compensation</i>.&quot; Here, again, while purporting to quote
me, Mr. Bowles omits the all-important words now italicised.
I am, however, maltreated in good company. Mr. Bowles
represents Lord Stowell as holding that destruction of neutral
property cannot be justified, even in cases of the gravest
<span class="newpage"><a name="page179" id="page179">[179]</a></span>importance to the captor's own State. What Lord Stowell
actually says, in the very passage quoted by Mr. Bowles, is
that &quot;to the neutral can only be justified, under any such
circumstances, by a full restitution in value.&quot; I would,
suggest that Mr. Bowles should find an opportunity for
reading <i>in extenso</i> the reports of the <i>Actaeon</i> (2 Dods. 48),
and the <i>Felicity</i> (<i>ib.</i> 881), as also for re-reading the passage
which occurs at p. 386 of the latter case, before venturing
further into the somewhat intricate technicalities of prize
law.</p>

<p class="lettertitle"><a name="THE-SINKING-OF-NEUTRAL-PRIZES" />THE SINKING OF NEUTRAL PRIZES</p>

<p>Sir,&mdash;In your St. Petersburg correspondence of yesterday
I see that some reference is made to what I have had occasion
to say from time to time upon the vexed question of the
sinking of neutral vessels, and your Correspondent thinks it
&quot;would be decidedly interesting&quot; to know whether I have
really changed my opinion on the subject. Perhaps, therefore,
I may be allowed to state that my opinion on the
subject has suffered no change, and may be summarised as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. There is no established rule of international law which
absolutely forbids, under any circumstances, the sinking of
a neutral prize. A <i>consensus gentium</i> to this effect will
hardly be alleged by those who are aware that such sinking
is permitted by the most recent prize regulations of France,
Russia, Japan, and the United States.</p>

<p>2. It is much to be desired that the practice should be,
by future international agreement, absolutely forbidden&mdash;- that
the lenity of British practice in this respect should
become internationally obligatory.</p>

<p>3. In the meantime, to adopt the language of the French
instructions, &quot;On ne doit user de ce droit de destruction
<span class="newpage"><a name="page180" id="page180">[180]</a></span>qu'avec plus la grande r&eacute;serve&quot;; and it may well be that
any given set of instructions (<i>e.g.</i> the Russian) leaves on
this point so large a discretion to commanders of cruisers
as to constitute an intolerable grievance.</p>

<p>4. In any case, the owner of neutral property, not proved
to be good prize, is entitled to the fullest compensation for
his loss. In the language of Lord Stowell:&mdash;</p>

<div class="letterquot"><p>&quot;The destruction of the property may have been a meritorious act
towards his own Government; but still the person to whom the
property belongs must not be a sufferer ... if the captor has by the
act of destruction conferred a benefit upon the public, he must look to
his own Government for his indemnity.&quot;</p></div>

<p>It may be worth while to add that the published statements
on the subject for which I am responsible are contained
in the <i>Admiralty Manual of Prize Law</i> of 1888 (where
section 808 sets out the lenient British instructions to commanders,
without any implication that instructions of a
severer kind would have been inconsistent with international
law); in letters which appeared in your columns on August
6, 17, and 30, 1904; and in a paper on &quot;Neutral Duties in a
Maritime War, as illustrated by recent events,&quot; read before
the British Academy in April last, a French translation of
which is in circulation on the Continent.</p>

<div class="postnotes"><p>The Russian circular of April 3, 1906, inviting the Powers to a second
Peace Conference, included amongst the topics for discussion: &quot;Destruction
par force majeure des b&acirc;timents de commerce neutres arr&ecirc;t&eacute;s
comme prises,&quot; and the British delegates were instructed to urge the
acceptance of what their Government had maintained to be the existing
rule on the subject. The Conference of 1907 declined, however, to
define existing law, holding that its business was solely to consider what
should be the law in future. After long discussions, in the course of
which frequent reference was made to views expressed by the present
writer (see <i>Actes et Documents</i>, t. iii. pp. 991-993, 1010, 1016, 1018,
1048, 1171), the Conference failed to arrive at any conclusion as to the
desirability of prohibiting the destruction of neutral prizes, and confined
itself to the expression of a wish (<i>v&oelig;u</i>) that this, and other un<span class="newpage"><a name="page181" id="page181">[181]</a></span>settled
points in the law of naval warfare, should be dealt with by a
subsequent Conference.</p>

<p>This question was, accordingly, one of those submitted to a Conference
of ten maritime Powers, which was convoked by Great Britain
in 1908, for reasons upon which something will be said in the next
section.</p>

<p>The question of sinking was fully debated in this Conference,
with the assistance of memoranda, in which the several Powers represented
explained their divergent views upon it, and of reports prepared
by committees specially appointed for the purpose. It soon became
apparent that the British proposal for an absolute prohibition of the
destruction of neutral prizes had no chance of being accepted; while,
on the other hand, it was generally agreed that the practice is permissible
only in exceptional cases. (See <i>Parl. Paper, Miscell.</i> No. 5 (1909),
pp. 2-63, 99-102, 120, 189, 205, 215, 223, 248, 268-278, 323, 365.)
Arts. 48-54 of the Declaration, signed by the delegates to the Conference
on February 26, 1909, but not ratified by Great Britain, related to this
question. After laying down, in Art. 48, the general principle that
&quot;a neutral prize cannot be destroyed by the captor, but should be
taken into such port as is proper for the legal decision of the rightfulness
of the capture&quot; the Declaration proceeded, in Art. 49, to qualify this
principle by providing that &quot;exceptionally, a neutral vessel captured
by a belligerent warship, which would be liable to confiscation, may be
destroyed, if obedience to Art. 48 might compromise the safety of the
warship, or the success of the operations in which she is actually
engaged.&quot;</p></div>

<p class="subsectionhead">An International Prize Court</p>

<div class="intronotes"><p>The forecast, incidentally attempted in the following letters,
of the general results likely to be arrived at by the second Peace
Conference, has been justified by the event. As much may be
claimed for the views maintained upon the topic with which these
letters were more specifically concerned. Instead of letting loose the
judges of the proposed International prize Court to &quot;make law,&quot; in
accordance with what might happen to be their notions of &quot;the general
principles of justice and equity,&quot; a serious attempt has been made to
supply them with a Code of the law which they would be expected to
administer.</p>

<p>Some account will be given at the end of this section of the movement
towards the establishment of an International Court of Appeal in
oases of prize.<span class="newpage"><a name="page182" id="page182">[182]</a></span></p></div>


<p class="lettertitle"><a name="AN-INTERNATIONAL-PRIZE-COURT" />AN INTERNATIONAL PRIZE COURT</p>

<p>Sir&mdash;The idea suggested by the question addressed
on February 19 to the Government by Mr. A. Herbert&mdash;<i>viz.</i>
that the appeal in prize cases should lie, not to a Court
belonging to the belligerent from whose Court of first instance
the appeal is brought, but to an international tribunal, has
a plausible appearance of fairness, but involves many preliminary
questions which must not be lost sight of.</p>

<p>Prize Courts are, at present, Courts of enquiry, to which
a belligerent Government entrusts the duty of ascertaining
whether the captures made by its officers have been properly
made, according to the views of international law entertained
by that Government. There exists, no doubt, among
Continental jurists, a considerable body of opinion in favour
of giving to Courts of Appeal, at any rate, in prize cases a
wholly different character. This opinion found its expression
in Arts. 100-109 of the <i>Code des Prises maritimes</i>, finally
adopted at its Heidelberg meeting, in 1887, by the Institut
de Droit International. Art. 100 runs as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="letterquot"><p>&quot;Au d&eacute;but de chaque guerre, chacune des parties bellig&eacute;rantes
constitue un tribunal international d'appel en mati&egrave;re de prises
maritimes. Chacun de ces tribunaux est compos&eacute; de cinq membres,
design&eacute;s comme suit: L'&eacute;tat bellig&eacute;rant nommera lui-m&ecirc;me le pr&eacute;sident
et un des membres. Il d&eacute;signera en outre trois &eacute;tats neutres,
qui choisiront chacun un des trois autres membres.&quot;</p></div>

<p>In the abstract, and supposing that a tribunal perfectly
satisfactory both to belligerents and neutrals could be
constituted, whether antecedently or <i>ad hoc</i>, there might be
much to be said for the proposal; subject, however, to one
condition&mdash;<i>viz.</i> that an agreement had been previously
arrived at as to the law which the Court is to apply. At the
present time there exists, on many vital questions of prize
law, no such agreement. It will be sufficient to mention
those relating to the list of contraband, the distinction
between &quot;absolute&quot; and &quot;conditional&quot; contraband, the
<span class="newpage"><a name="page183" id="page183">[183]</a></span>doctrine of &quot;continuous voyages,&quot; the right of sinking a
neutral prize, the moment from which a vessel becomes
liable for breach of blockade.</p>

<p>Just as the <i>Alabama</i> arbitration would have been impossible
had not an agreement been arrived at upon the
principles in accordance with which neutral duties as to the
exit of ships of war were to be construed, so, also, before an
international Court can be empowered to decide questions
of prize, whether in the first instance or on appeal, it is indispensable
that the law to be applied on the points above
mentioned, and many others, should have been clearly
defined and accepted, if not generally, at least by all parties
concerned. The moral which I would venture to draw is,
therefore, that although questions of fact, arising out of
capture of a prize, might sometimes be submitted to a
tribunal of arbitration, no case, involving rules of law as
to which nations take different views, could possibly be so
submitted. One is glad, therefore, to notice that the Prime
Minister's reply to Mr. A. Herbert was of the most guarded
character. The settlement of the law of prize must necessarily
precede any general resort to an international prize
Court; and if the coming Hague Conference does no more
than settle some of the most pressing of these questions, it
will have done much to promote the cause of peace.</p>

<p class="lettertitle"><a name="A-NEW-PRIZE-LAW" />A NEW PRIZE LAW</p>

<p>Sir,&mdash;The leading articles which you have recently
published upon the doings of the Peace Conference, as also
the weighty letter addressed to you by my eminent colleague,
Professor Westlake, will have been welcomed by many of
your readers who are anxious that the vital importance of
some of the questions under discussion at The Hague should
not be lost sight of.<span class="newpage"><a name="page184" id="page184">[184]</a></span></p>

<p>The Conference may now be congratulated upon having
already given a <i>quietus</i> to several proposals for which,
whether or not they may be rightly described as Utopian,
the time is admittedly not yet ripe. Such has been the fate
of the suggestions for the limitation of armaments, and
the exemption from capture of private property at sea.
Such also, there is every reason to hope, is the destiny which
awaits the still more objectionable proposals for rendering
obligatory the resort to arbitration, which by the Convention
of 1899 was wisely left optional.</p>

<p>Should the labours of the delegates succeed in placing
some restrictions upon the employment of submarine mines,
the bombardment of open coast towns, and the conversion of
merchant vessels into ships of war; in making some slight
improvements in each of the three Conventions of 1899; and
in solving some of the more pressing questions as to the
rights and duties of neutrals, especially with reference to
the reception in their ports of belligerent warships, it will
have more than justified the hopes for its success which have
been entertained by persons conversant with the difficulty
and complexity of the problems involved.</p>

<p>But what shall we say of certain proposals for revolutionising
the law of prize, which still remain for consideration,
notably for the establishment of an international Court
of Appeal, and for the abolition of contraband? It can
hardly be supposed that either suggestion will win its way
to acceptance.</p>

<p>1. The British scheme for an international Court of
Appeal in prize cases is, indeed, far preferable to the German;
but the objections to anything of the kind would seem to be,
for the present, insuperable, were it only for the reason which
you allowed me to point out, some months ago, <i>&agrave; propos</i> of
a question put in the House of Commons by Mr. Arnold
Herbert. As long as nations hold widely different views
on many points of prize law, it cannot be expected that they
should agree beforehand that, when belligerent, they will
<span class="newpage"><a name="page185" id="page185">[185]</a></span>leave it to a board of arbitrators to say which of several
competing rules shall be applied to any given case of capture,
or to evolve out of their inner consciousness a new rule,
hitherto unknown to any national prize Court. It would
seem that the German advocates of the innovation claim
in its favour the authority of the Institut de Droit International.
Permit me, therefore, as one who has taken part in
all the discussions of the Institut upon the subject, to state
that when it was first handled, at Zurich, in 1878, the difficulties
in the way of an international Court were insisted on
by such men as Asser, Bernard, Bluntschli, Bulmerincq, and
Neumann, and the vote of a majority in its favour was
coupled with one which demanded the acceptance by treaty
of a universally applicable system of prize law. The
drafting of such a system was accordingly the main object
of the <i>Code des Prises maritimes</i>, which, after occupying
several sessions of the Institut, was finally adopted by it,
at Heidelberg, in 1887. Only ten of the 122 sections of this
Code deal with an international Court of Appeal. A complete
body of law, by which States have agreed to be bound,
must, one would think, necessarily precede the establishment
of a mixed Court by which that law is to be interpreted.</p>

<p>2. While the several delegations are vying with one
another in devising new definitions of contraband, there
would seem to be little likelihood that the British proposal
for its total abandonment will be seriously entertained.
Such a step could be justified, if at all, from the point of
view of national interest, only on the ground that it might
possibly throw increased difficulties in the way of an enemy
desirous, even by straining the existing law, of interfering
with the supply of foodstuffs to the British Islands. I
propose, for the present, only to call attention to the concluding
paragraph of the British notice of motion on this
point, which would seem to imply much more than the
abandonment of contraband. The words in question, if
indeed they are authentically reported, are as follows:<span class="newpage"><a name="page186" id="page186">[186]</a></span>
&quot;Le droit de visite ne serait exerc&eacute; que pour constater le
caract&egrave;re neutre du b&acirc;timent de commerce.&quot; Does this
mean that the visiting officer, as soon as he has ascertained
from the ship's papers that she is neutral property, is to
make his bow and return to the cruiser whence he came?
If so, what has become of our existing right to detain any
vessel which has sailed for a blockaded port, or is carrying,
as a commercial venture, or even ignorantly, hostile troops
or despatches? No such definition as is proposed of an
&quot;auxiliary ship-of-war&quot; would safeguard the right in
question, since a ship, to come within that definition, must,
it appears, be under the orders of a belligerent fleet.</p>

<p>I would venture to suggest that the motto of a reformer
of prize law should be <i>festina lente.</i> The existing system is
the fruit of practical experience extending over several
centuries, and, though it may need, here and there, some
readjustment to new conditions, brought about by the
substitution of steam for sails, is not one which can safely
be pulled to pieces in a couple of months. Let us leave
something for future Hague Conferences.</p>

<p class="lettertitle"><a name="A-NEW-PRIZE-LAW-B" />A NEW PRIZE LAW</p>

<p>Sir,&mdash;In a letter under the above heading, for which you
were so good as to find room in July last, I returned to the
thesis which I had ventured to maintain some months
previously, <i>&agrave; propos</i> of a question put in the House of
Commons. My contention was that the establishment of
an international prize Court, assuming it to be under any
circumstances desirable, should follow, not precede, a general
international agreement as to the law which the Court is to
administer.</p>

<p>It would appear, from such imperfect information as
intermittently reaches Swiss mountain hotels, that a con<span class="newpage"><a name="page187" id="page187">[187]</a></span>viction
of the truth of this proposition is at length making
way among the delegates to The Hague Conference and
among observers of its doings. In a recent number of the
<i>Courrier de la Conf&eacute;rence</i>, a publication which cannot be
accused of lukewarmness in the advocacy of proposals for
the peaceful settlement of international differences, I find
an article entitled &quot;Pas de Code Naval, pas de Cour des
Prises,&quot; to the effect that &quot;l'acceptation de la Cour des
Prises est strictement conditionnelle &agrave; la r&eacute;daction du Code,
qu'elle aura &agrave; interpr&eacute;ter.&quot; Its decisions must otherwise
be founded upon the opinions of its Judges, &quot;the majority
of whom will belong to a school which has never accepted
what Great Britain looks upon as the fundamental principles
of naval warfare.&quot; One learns also from other sources,
that efforts are being made to arrive, by a series of compromises,
at some common understanding upon the points
as to which the differences of view between the Powers are
most pronounced. It may, however, be safely predicted
that many years must elapse before any such result will
be achieved.</p>

<p>In the meantime, a very different solution of the difficulty
has commended itself to the partisans of the proposed Court.
M. Renault, the accomplished Reporter of the committee
which deals in the first instance with the subject, after
stating that &quot;sur beaucoup de points le droit de la guerre
maritime est encore incertain, et chaque &Eacute;tat le formule
au gr&eacute; de ses id&eacute;es et de ses int&eacute;r&ecirc;ts,&quot; lays down that, in
accordance with strict juridical reasoning, when international
law is silent an international Court should apply the law of
the captor. He is, nevertheless, prepared to recommend,
as the spokesman of the committee, that in such cases the
Judges should decide &quot;d'apr&egrave;s les
<ins class="correction"
  title="Transcriber's note: Printed as _principles_ in original text.">
principes</ins> g&eacute;n&eacute;raux de la
justice et de l'&eacute;quit&eacute;&quot;&mdash;a process which I had, less complimentarily,
described as &quot;evolving new rules out of their inner
consciousness.&quot; The Court, in pursuance of this confessedly
&quot;hardie solution,&quot; would be called upon to &quot;faire le droit.&quot;<span class="newpage"><a name="page188" id="page188">[188]</a></span></p>

<p>One may be permitted to hope that this proposal will
not be accepted. The beneficent action of English Judges
in developing the common law of England may possibly
be cited in its favour; but the analogy is delusive. The
Courts of a given country in evolving new rules of law are
almost certain to do so in accordance with the views of
public policy generally entertained in that country. Should
they act otherwise their error can be promptly corrected by
the national Legislature. Far different would be the effect
of the decision of an international Court, in which, though
it might run directly counter to British theory and practice,
Great Britain would have bound herself beforehand to
acquiesce. The only quasi-legislative body by which the
<i>ratio decidendi</i> of such a decision could be disallowed would
be an international gathering in which British views might
find scanty support. The development of a system of
national law by national Judges offers no analogy to the
working of an international Court, empowered, at its free
will and pleasure, to disregard the views of a sovereign
Power as to the proper rule to be applied in cases as to
which international law gives no guidance. In such cases
the ultimate adjustment of differences of view is the
appropriate work, not of a law Court, but of diplomacy.</p>

<p>It is hardly necessary to combat the notion that there
already exists, <i>in nubibus</i>, a complete system of prize law,
which is in some mysterious way accessible to Judges, and
reveals to them the rule applicable to each new case as it
arises. This notion, so far as it is prevalent, seems to have
arisen from a mistaken reading of certain <i>dicta</i> of Lord
Stowell, in which that great Judge, in his finest eighteenth-century
manner, insists that the law which it was his duty
to administer &quot;has no locality&quot; and &quot;belongs to other
nations as well as our own.&quot; He was, of course, thinking
of the rules of prize law upon which the nations are agreed,
not of the numerous questions upon which no agreement
exists, and was dealing with the difficult position of a Judge
<span class="newpage"><a name="page189" id="page189">[189]</a></span>who has to choose (as in the recent <i>Moray Firth</i> case) between
obedience to such rules and obedience to the legislative,
or quasi-legislative, acts of his own Government.</p>

<p>Sir,&mdash;The speech of the Prime Minister at the Guildhall
contains a paragraph which will be read with a sense of relief
by those who, like myself, have all along viewed with
surprise and apprehension The Hague proposals for an
international prize Court.</p>

<p>Sir H. Campbell-Bannerman admits that &quot;it is desirable,
and it may be essential, that, before legislation can be undertaken
to make such a Court effective, the leading maritime
nations should come to an agreement as to the rules regarding
some of the more important subjects of warfare which
are to be administered by the Court&quot;; and his subsequent
eulogy of the Court presupposes that it is provided with
&quot;a body of rules which has received the sanction of the great
maritime Powers.&quot; What is said as to the necessary postponement
of any legislation in the sense of The Hague
Convention must, of course, apply <i>a fortiori</i> to the ratification
of the Convention.</p>

<p>We have here, for the first time, an authoritative repudiation
of the notion that fifteen gentlemen of mixed nationality
composing an international prize Court, are to be let loose
to &quot;make law,&quot; in accordance with what may happen to be
their conceptions of &quot;justice and equity.&quot; It seems at last
to be recognised that such a Court cannot be set to work
unless, and until, the great maritime Powers shall have come
to an agreement upon the rules of law which the Court is to
administer.</p>

<p>I may add that it is surely too much to expect that
the rules in question will be discussed by the Powers, to
<span class="newpage"><a name="page190" id="page190">[190]</a></span>use Sir H. Campbell-Bannerman's phrase, &quot;without any
political <i>arri&egrave;re pens&ecirc;e.</i>&quot; Compromise between opposing
political interests must ever remain one of the most important
factors in the development of the law of nations.</p>

<div class="postnotes"><p>Although the establishment of an International Prize Court of
Appeal was not one of the topics included in the programme of the
Russian invitation; to a second Peace Conference, no objection was made
to its being taken into consideration, when proposals to that effect
were made by the British and American delegates to the Conference.
The idea seems first to have been suggested by H&uuml;bner, who proposed
to confer jurisdiction in cases of neutral prize on Courts composed
of ministers or consuls, accredited by neutrals to the belligerents,
together with commissioners appointed by the Sovereign of the captors
or of the country to which the prize has been brought, as also, perhaps,
&quot;des personnes pleines de probit&eacute; et de connaissances dans tout ce
qui concerne les Loix des Nations et les Trait&eacute;s des Puissances
modernes.&quot; The Court is to decide in accordance with treaties, &quot;ou,
&agrave; leur d&eacute;faut, la loi universelle des nations.&quot; <i>De la Saisie des B&acirc;timents
neutres</i> (1759), ii. pp. 45-61. The Institut de Droit International,
after discussions extending over several years, accepted the principle
of an International Court of Appeal, though only in combination with a
complete scheme of prize law, in its <i>Code des Prises maritimes</i>, completed
in 1887, section 100.</p>

<p>At the Conference of 1907, the work of several committees, and a
masterly report by Professor Renault, <i>Parl. Papers</i>, No. iv. (1908), p. 9,
resulted in The Hague Convention, No. xii. of that year, providing for the
establishment of a mixed Court of Appeal from national prize Courts.</p>

<p>According to Art. 7 of this Convention, in default of any relevant
treaty between the Governments of the litigant parties, and of generally
recognised rules of international law bearing upon the question at issue,
the Court is to decide &quot;in accordance with the general principles of
justice and equity.&quot; It seems, however, to have been soon perceived
that the proposal to institute a Court, unprovided with any fixed
system of law by which to decide the cases which might be brought
before it, could not well be entertained, and the Final Act of the Conference
accordingly expresses a wish that &quot;the preparation of a
<i>R&egrave;glement</i>, relative to the laws and customs of maritime war, may be
mentioned in the programme of the next Conference.&quot;</p>

<p>Thereupon, without waiting for the meeting of a third Hague
Conference, the British Government on February 27, 1908, addressed a
<span class="newpage"><a name="page191" id="page191">[191]</a></span>circular to the great maritime Powers, which, after alluding to the
impression gained &quot;that the establishment of the International Prize
Court would not meet with general acceptance so long as vagueness
and uncertainty exist as to the principles which the Court, in dealing
with appeals brought before it, would apply to questions of far-reaching
importance, affecting naval policy and practice,&quot; went on to
propose that another Conference should meet in London, in the autumn
of the same year, &quot;with the object of arriving at an agreement as to
what are the generally recognised principles of international law
within the meaning of paragraph 2 of Article 7 of the Convention, as
to those matters wherein the practice of nations has varied, and of
then formulating the rules which, in the absence of special treaty
provisions applicable to a particular case, the Court should observe in
dealing with appeals brought before it for decision.... It would be
difficult, if not impossible, for H.M. Government to carry the legislation
necessary to give effect to the Convention, unless they could assure
both Houses of the British Parliament that some more definite understanding
had been reached as to the rules by which the new Tribunal
should be governed.&quot;</p>

<p>In response to this invitation, delegates from ten principal maritime
States assembled at the Foreign Office on December 4, 1908,
and after discussing the topics to which their attention was directed,
viz.: (1) Contraband; (2) Blockade; (3) Continuous voyage; (4)
Destruction of neutral prizes; (5) Unneutral service; (6) Conversion
of merchant vessels into warships on the high seas; (7) Transfer to a
neutral flag; (8) Nationality or domicil, as the test of enemy property;
signed on February 26, 1909, the Declaration of London.</p>

<p>The Convention No. xii. of 1907 and the Declaration of London
of 1909 have alike failed to obtain ratification. <i>Cf.</i> now the two
immediately following sections, 9 and 10.</p>

<p>An ultimate Court of Appeal in cases of Prize seems now likely
to be provided by the &quot;Permanent Court of International Justice,&quot;
proposed by the League of Nations in pursuance of Art. 14 of the
Treaty of Versailles. See also Art. 24 of the Treaty. <i>Cf. supra</i>, p. <a href="#page002">2</a>.</p></div>

<p class="lettertitle"><a name="THE-NAVAL-PRIZE-BILL-1910" />THE NAVAL PRIZE BILL</p>

<p>Sir&mdash;A paternal interest in the Naval Prize Bill may
perhaps be thought a sufficient excuse for the few remarks
which I am about to make upon it. The Bill owes its
existence to a suggestion made by me, just ten years ago,
while engaged in bringing up to date for the Admiralty
my <i>Manual of Naval Prise Law</i> of 1888. It was drafted
by me, after prolonged communications with Judges, Law
Officers, and the Government Departments concerned, so
as not only to reproduce the provisions of several &quot;cross
and cuffing&quot; statutes dealing with the subject, but also
to exhibit them in a more logical order than is always to
be met with in Acts of Parliament.</p>

<p>The Bill was thought of sufficient importance to be
mentioned on two occasions in the King's Speech, and has
been several times passed, after careful consideration, by
the House of Lords; but pressure of other business has
hitherto impeded its passage through the House of Commons.
It has now been reintroduced, this time in the Lower House,
with an imposing backing of Government support; primarily,
no doubt, with a view to facilitating the ratification of The
Hague Convention for the establishment of an International
Prize Court of Appeal. For this purpose, several pieces of
new cloth have been sewn into the old garment, and I
may perhaps be allowed to call attention to three or four
points in which, on a first reading, the new clauses strike
one as needing reconsideration.</p>

<p>Tactical reasons have, no doubt, operated to induce
the Government to include in the Consolidation Bill the
provisions for which statutory authority must be obtained
before it will be possible to ratify the Convention; instead
of first introducing a Bill having this sole object in view,
and afterwards, should this be passed, inserting the new
law in a reintroduced Consolidation Bill.<span class="newpage"><a name="page193" id="page193">[193]</a></span></p>

<p>The course adopted necessitates an otherwise unnecessary
preamble, and the qualification of the new Part III. by the
words &quot;in the event of an International Prize Court being
established&quot; (Clause 23). The reference, by the by, in
this clause to &quot;the said Convention&quot; is somewhat awkward,
no mention of any Convention having occurred previously,
except in the preamble of the Bill. Is not also the statutory
approval given by this clause, not only to the Convention
of 1907 but also to &quot;any Convention amending the same,&quot;
somewhat startling, as tending to exclude Parliamentary
criticism of such an amending Convention before its
ratification?</p>

<p>By Clause 9, the members of the Judicial Committee
who are to be nominated to act as the British Court of
Appeal in cases of prize are to be described by the novel
title of &quot;the Supreme Prize Court.&quot; Is not the use made
of the term &quot;Supreme&quot; in the Judicature Acts, as covering
both the High Court and the Court of Appeal, already
sufficiently unsatisfactory?</p>

<p>But the question which, of all others <i>saute aux yeux</i>,
in reading the new Part III., is whether the Convention is
to be approved as it stands, irrespectively of a general
acceptance of the new Code of Prize Law contained in the
Declaration of London of 1909. The objections to Art. 7
of the Contention, providing that, in the absence of rules
of International Law generally recognised (and on many
points of Prize Law there are no such rules), the Court is
to decide in accordance with (what it may be pleased to
consider) &quot;the general principles of law and equity,&quot; are
well known. The purpose of the Declaration of London
(itself the subject of much difference of opinion) was to
curtail this licence of decision, by providing the Court with
so much ascertained Prize Law as to render action under
the too-elastic phrase above quoted almost inconceivable.</p>

<p>Is it too much of a counsel of perfection to suggest that
the debatable questions arising under the Convention of<span class="newpage"><a name="page194" id="page194">[194]</a></span>
1907 and the Declaration of 1909 should first be threshed
out in discussions on a Bill dealing with those questions
only; and that the decision, if any, thus arrived at should
be subsequently inserted, freed from hypothesis, in the
Consolidation Bill which has so long awaited the leisure
of the House of Commons?</p>

<p class="lettertitle"><a name="THE-NAVAL-PRIZE-BILL-1911" />THE NAVAL PRIZE BILL</p>

<p>Sir,&mdash;The Government has so far yielded to the representations
of the Opposition as to have refrained from
forcing on Friday night a division upon the Naval Prize
Bill. Is it too much to hope that the Government may
even now withdraw altogether a measure so ill adapted
to place fairly before Parliament the question of the desirability
of ratifying two documents held by a large body of
competent opinion to be certain, if ratified, seriously to
endanger the vital interests of the country? The Bill,
as I have already pointed out, as originally drawn, was a
careful consolidation of the law and procedure governing
British Courts of Prize. Into this has now been incongruously
thrust a set of clauses intended to give effect to
a novel and highly controversial proposal for the creation
of an International Prize Court. About the Declaration of
London, alleged to contain a body of law which would
adequately equip such a Court for the performance of its
duties, not a word is said in the Bill; yet, should approval
of the Bill be snatched by a purely party majority, the
intention of the Government is to proceed straightway to
the ratification both of the Prize Court Convention and the
Declaration. Whether they intend also to endeavour to
obtain the ratification, as an auxiliary Convention, of the
lengthy covering commentary upon the Declaration, supplied
by the committee by which the Declaration was drafted,
<span class="newpage"><a name="page195" id="page195">[195]</a></span>does not yet appear. Of such a step I have already written
that it &quot;would be calamitous should a practice be introduced
of attempting to cure the imperfect expression of a treaty
by tacking on to it an equally authoritative reasoned commentary.
The result would be <i>obscurum per obscurius</i>, a
remedy worse than the disease.&quot;</p>

<p>The alternatives before Parliament on Monday next
will be either, by reading the Naval Prize Bill a second
time, to bring about, in the teeth of protests from those
best qualified to express an independent opinion upon the
subject, the immediate ratification of the Convention and
the Declaration, or to ask that before, this momentous step is
taken the infinitely complex and delicate questions involved
should be examined and passed upon by a Commission of
representative experts. Which shall it be?</p>

<p class="lettertitle"><a name="NAVAL-PRIZE-MONEY" />NAVAL PRIZE MONEY</p>

<p>Sir,&mdash;The existing enactments as to prize bounty are,
it seems, unsuitable to present conditions of naval warfare,
and are accordingly to be varied by a bill shortly to be
introduced.</p>

<p>May I venture to recommend that the Bill should contain
merely the half-dozen clauses needed for this purpose,
leaving untouched for subsequent uncontroversial passage,
the Naval Prize Consolidation with Amendments Bill?
This Bill, suggested and drafted by myself, in the spacious
times of peace, in consultation with the Admiralty and other
Government Departments, as also with the Judge of the
Admiralty Division and the Law Officers (including the
present Lord Chancellor), was twice mentioned in the King's
Speech, and several times, after careful consideration,
passed by the House of Lords, but still awaits the leisure of
<span class="newpage"><a name="page196" id="page196">[196]</a></span>the Lower House. It deserved a better fate than to have
been used, in 1911, as a corpus vile for facilitating the ratification
of the Convention for an International Prize Court and
of the Declaration of London; receiving, most fortunately,
as so perverted, its <i>coup de gr&acirc;ce</i> from the Lords. It should
be passed as an artistic whole, apart from any contentious
matter, account having, of course, been taken of recent
legislation by which it may have been, here and there,
affected.</p>

<p class="lettertitle"><a name="THE-DECLARATION-OF-LONDON-1909" />THE DECLARATION OF LONDON</p>

<p>Sir,&mdash;The questions put last night by Mr. M'Arthur need,
perhaps, more fully considered answers than they received
from Mr. McKinnon Wood.</p>

<p>With reference to the first answer, it may be worth while
to point out that, in Art. 66 of the Declaration, the Powers
undertake not only, as in the passage quoted, &quot;to give the
necessary instructions to their authorities and armed forces,&quot;
but also &quot;to take the measures which may be proper for
guaranteeing the application of the rules Contained in the
Declaration by their Courts, and, in particular, by their
Courts of Prize.&quot; The &quot;authentic commentary&quot; upon the
<span class="newpage"><a name="page197" id="page197">[197]</a></span>article in M. Renault's &quot;Report&quot; explains that the measures
in question &quot;may vary in different countries, and may or
may not require the intervention of the Legislature.&quot;</p>

<p>The second answer lays down broadly that &quot;the decisions
of the British Prize Courts are founded on International
Law, and not on municipal enactments.&quot; Our Prize Courts
have, no doubt, on most points, decided in accordance with
International Law, in the sense of the principles generally
followed by civilised nations; but, on not a few points, in
accordance with the British view of what is, or ought to be,
International Law, in opposition to views persistently maintained
by other countries&mdash;<i>e.g.</i> with reference to the moment
from which a blockade-runner becomes liable to capture.
The fact is that, whatever grandiloquent language may have
been judicially employed by Lord Stowell in a contrary
sense, it will now hardly be denied that a Prize Court sits
by national, not international, authority, and is bound
to take the view of International Law which, if any, is
prescribed to it by the constitutionally expressed will of
its own Government.</p>

<p>The Declaration of London is in many ways a great
achievement; but one is glad to learn from Mr. McKinnon
Wood's third answer that opportunity will be given for
discussing all important points in connexion with its rules.</p>

<p class="lettertitle"><a name="THE-DECLARATION-OF-LONDON-1910" />THE DECLARATION OF LONDON</p>

<p>Sir,&mdash;Both the Prize Court Convention of 1907 and
its complement, the London Declaration of 1909, stand
greatly in need of full and well-informed discussion before
receiving the Parliamentary approval which ought to be a
condition precedent to the ratification of either of them. It
is well, therefore, that many Chambers of Commerce have
called the attention of Government to the detriment to<span class="newpage"><a name="page198" id="page198">[198]</a></span>
British interest which may in their opinion result from these
agreements if ratified, although the representations thus
made exhibit, in some cases, so little technical knowledge as
to have been readily disposed of by the Foreign Secretary.
For the same reason, I welcome the letter from Mr. Gibson
Bowles, which appeared in <i>The Times</i> of yesterday, although
it contains some statements the inaccuracy of which it
may be desirable at once to point out.</p>

<p>1. The Declaration of Paris is neither implicitly nor
explicitly adopted by the Declaration of London, &quot;as a part
of the common law of nations which can no longer be disputed.&quot;
The later makes no mention of the earlier one,
and M. Benault's <i>rapport</i> (as to the interpretative authority
of which opinions may well differ) applies the words quoted,
not to the Paris Declaration as a whole, but to one only of
its articles. Mr. Bowles's statement that &quot;the Declaration
of London, if adopted, would reaffirm, and its ratification
would in effect, for the first time ratify, the Declaration of
Paris&quot; cannot be supported.</p>

<p>2. Mr. Bowles asserts it to be &quot;an unquestioned doctrine
of the Law of Nations that war abrogates and annuls treaty
obligations between belligerents.&quot; One would have supposed
it to be common knowledge that large classes of treaties
are wholly unaffected by war. Such are, for instance, what
are called conventions <i>transitoires</i>, because their effect is
produced once for all, as in the case of cessions of territory;
and, notably, treaties entered into for the regulation of the
conduct of war, such as the Geneva Convention, many of
The Hague Conventions of 1907, and the Declaration of
Paris itself, which Mr. Bowles appears to think would <i>ipso
facto</i> cease to be obligatory between its signatories on their
becoming belligerent.</p>

<p>It is a pleasure to be able to agree with Mr. Bowles in
his wish that the Naval Prize Bill, if reintroduced, should
be rejected, though I would rather say &quot;withdrawn.&quot;
You have already allowed me (on July 10) to point out that
<span class="newpage"><a name="page199" id="page199">[199]</a></span>if the Convention and Declaration are to be effectively
discussed in Parliament they should be disentangled from
that Bill, into which the Convention, and, by implication,
the Declaration, have been incongruously thrust. This
practically non-contentious Consolidation Bill, after several
times securing the approval of the House of Lords, has
hitherto for several years awaited the leisure of the House
of Commons, but was suddenly reintroduced last Session,
apparently as an unobtrusive vehicle for the new and highly
debatable matter contained in the two above-mentioned
documents. May I now repeat my suggestion that &quot;the
debatable questions arising under the Convention of
1907 and the Declaration of 1909 should first be threshed
out in discussions on a Bill dealing with these questions
only; and that the decision, if any, thus arrived at should
be subsequently inserted, freed from hypothesis, in the
Consolidation Bill&quot;?</p>

<p class="lettertitle"><a name="THE-DECLARATION-OF-LONDON-1911" />THE DECLARATION OF LONDON</p>

<p>Sir,&mdash;I have read Professor Westlake's letters upon the
Declaration of London with the attention due to anything
written by my very learned friend, but, although myself
opposed to the ratification alike of the Prize Court Convention
and of its complement, the Declaration, do not at
present wish to enter upon the demerits of either instrument.</p>

<p>There is, however, a preliminary question upon which,
with your permission, I should like to say a few words.
My friend justly observes that in dealing with the Declaration
&quot;the first necessity is to know what it is that we have
before us&quot;; and he devotes his letter of January 31 to
maintaining that the Declaration must be read as interpreted
by the explanations of it given to the full Conference
by the Drafting Committee, of which M. Renault was presi<span class="newpage"><a name="page200" id="page200">[200]</a></span>dent.
Professor Westlake supports his opinion by a quotation
from the reply of the Foreign Office in November last to
the Edinburgh Chamber of Commerce (<i>Miscell.</i> 1910, No. 4,
p. 21). I may mention that a similar reply had been given,
a year previously, by Mr. McKinnon Wood to a question in
the House of Commons. The source of these replies is
doubtless to be found in a paragraph of the Report, addressed
on March 1, 1909, to Sir Edward Grey, of the British
Delegates to the London Conference, which runs as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="letterquot"><p>&quot;It should be borne in mind that, in accordance with the principles
and practice of Continental jurisprudence, such a Report is considered
an authoritative statement of the meaning and intention of the instrument
which it explains, and that consequently foreign Governments
and Courts, and no doubt also the International Prize Court, will
construe and interpret the provisions of the Declaration by the light
of the Commentary given in the Report.&quot; (<i>Miscell.</i> 1909, No. 4, p. 94.)</p></div>

<p>It is desirable to know upon what authority this statement
rests. I am aware of none. The nearest approach to
an assertion of anything like it occurred at The Hague
Conference of 1899, when the &quot;approval&quot; accorded to
&quot;the work of the Second Committee, as embodied in the
articles voted and in the interpretative Report which
accompanies them&quot; was alleged by M. de Martens to
amount to an acceptance of the Report &quot;comme un commentaire
interpr&eacute;tatif authentique des articles vot&eacute;s.&quot;
(<i>Miscell.</i> 1899, No. 1, p. 165.) The drafting Report presented
to the Geneva Conference of 1906 is merely said to
have been &quot;adopted&quot; (Actes, p. 286); and M. Renault's
Report to the Conference of London was similarly merely
&quot;accepted,&quot; although he presented it as containing</p>

<div class="letterquot"><p>&quot;Un commentaire pr&eacute;cis, d&eacute;gag&eacute; de tout controverse, qui, devenu
commentaire officiel par l'approbation de la Conf&eacute;rence, soit de nature
&agrave; guider les autorit&eacute;s diverses, administratives, militaires, judiciaires,
qui pourront avoir &agrave; l'appliquer.&quot; (<i>Miscell.</i> 1909, No. 5, p. 344.)</p></div>

<p>It would seem that in each of these cases the adoption
of the Report, and even a suggestion or two for a change
<span class="newpage"><a name="page201" id="page201">[201]</a></span>in its phraseology, amounted to nothing more than an
expression of opinion on the part of the Delegates to the
Conference that the Report contained explanations which
had satisfied themselves, and might satisfy their Governments,
that the Convention which they were about to
forward to those Governments might safely be accepted.</p>

<p>So far as Governments are concerned, the adoption of a
Report by their Delegates is <i>res inter alios acta</i>. An &quot;authentic
interpretation&quot; of a contract can be given only by
the parties to it, who, in the case of a treaty, are the States
concerned. If these States desire to give to the report of
a drafting committee the force of an authentic interpretation
of their contract, they can surely do so only by something
amounting to a supplementary convention. Writers upon
international law naturally throw but little light upon
questions to which the somewhat novel practice of argumentative
drafting Reports has given rise; but I may cite
Professor Ullmann, of Vienna, as saying:&mdash;</p>

<div class="letterquot"><p>&quot;Eine authentische Interpretation kann nur die durch Kontrahenten
selbst, in einem gemeinschaftlichen, ihren Willen ausser Zweifel
setzenden Acte (einem Nachtrags-oder Erlauterungsvertrage), erfolgen&quot;
(Volkerrecht, p. 282);</p></div>

<p>and Professor Fiore, of Naples, to the effect that what is
called &quot;authentic interpretation&quot; is not</p>

<div class="letterquot"><p>&quot;interpretazione propriamente detta, ma una dichiarazione di quello
che fu gia concordato, o un nuovo trattato&quot; (Diritto Internazionale,
ss. 1, 118);</p></div>

<p>and that</p>

<div class="letterquot"><p>&quot;il trattato non pu&ograve; essere interpretato che dalle stesse Parti (<i>i.e.</i> Stati)
contrahenti; e per la validit&agrave; dell' atto &egrave; indispensabile che la relativa
convenzione di interpretazione abbia gli stessi requisiti ... di ogni
altra convenzione tra Stato e Stato&quot; (Il Dir. Int. Codif., &sect; 816).</p></div>

<p>I would submit that such a Report as that which accompanies
the Declaration of London has no claim to the sort
of interpretative authority which has been attributed to it;
nor is it desirable that the requisite steps should be taken
<span class="newpage"><a name="page202" id="page202">[202]</a></span>for giving it that authority. It would be calamitous should
a practice be introduced of attempting to cure the imperfect
expression of a treaty by tacking on to it an equally authoritative
reasoned commentary, likely, as in the present case,
to be enormously longer than the test to which it relates.</p>

<p>It is a wholly different question whether Governments
or Courts would be inclined to take notice of such a Report,
among other facts antecedent to a Convention, or Declaration,
which they might be called upon to construe. A
British Court would not, I conceive, be so inclined. On
the probable inclinations of Continental Courts, and of an
International Prize Court, should one be instituted, further
expert information would seem to be called for.</p>

<p>The fact is that the vitally important questions of theory
and practice raised by the Convention and the Declaration
need calmer and better instructed discussion than they have
yet received. Ought they not to be referred to a Royal
Commission, on which should be placed representatives
of the Navy and Merchant Service, of the corn trade, and
of the Colonies, together with international lawyers, in
touch with the views of their Continental colleagues?</p>

<p class="lettertitle"><a name="THE-DECLARATION-OF-LONDON-1911-B" />THE DECLARATION OF LONDON</p>

<p>Sir,&mdash;Professor Westlake, replying in <i>The Times</i> of
to-day to the arguments by which I had endeavoured to
show that the Report made to the Conference of London has
no pretensions to be treated as an authentic interpretation
of the Declaration prepared by the Conference, still maintains
that &quot;the essential question will be, what the agreement
was that the Conference arrived at.&quot; I had maintained,
on the contrary, that the essential question will
be, What is the agreement entered into by the Powers, as
evidenced by their ratifications? anything outside of the
<span class="newpage"><a name="page203" id="page203">[203]</a></span>ratified agreement being <i>res inter alios acta</i>. I should not
be justified in asking you to allow me to repeat the contents
of my letter of Monday last in support of this view. The
pleadings are, I think, exhausted. &quot;Therefore let a jury
come.&quot;</p>

<p>I should like, however, to point out that I did not, as
my friend seems to think, attribute the acceptance of the
Report to the delegates &quot;singly.&quot; It was, no doubt
accepted by all present without protest. My colleague
will, I am sure, pardon me if I add that I cannot concur in
his exegesis of my citations from Ullmann and Fiore.</p>

<p class="lettertitle"><a name="THE-DECLARATION-OF-LONDON-1911-C" />THE DECLARATION OF LONDON</p>

<p>Sir,&mdash;It is satisfactory that so high an authority as Mr.
Arthur Cohen distinctly accedes to the view that the Declaration
of London ought not to be ratified as it stands. I
should, however, be sorry were his suggestion accepted that
the Declaration and the argumentative report which accompanies
it might be ratified together. The result would be
<i>obscurum per obscurius</i>, a remedy worse than the disease.</p>

<p>I shall ask leave to add that, if Mr. Cohen will take the
trouble to look again at my letters of February 10 and 25,
he will cease to suppose it possible that in writing &quot;the
pleadings are, I think, exhausted, &amp;c.,&quot; I meant to convey
that no further discussion of the merits or demerits of the
Declaration was required. On the contrary I expressly
limited myself to a consideration of the preliminary question,
whether interpretative authority would rightly be attributed
to the report in question, stating that, while opposed to the
ratification alike of the Prize Court Convention and of the
Declaration, I did not, for the present, wish to enter upon
the demerits of either instrument; and ended my first
letter by suggesting the reference to a Royal Commission of<span class="newpage"><a name="page204" id="page204">[204]</a></span>

<p class="lettertitle"><a name="THE-DECLARATION-OF-LONDON-1915" />THE DECLARATION OF LONDON</p>

<p>Sir,&mdash;After Tuesday's debate in the House of Lords
it may be hoped that not even &quot;the man in the street&quot;
will suppose the Declaration of London to be anything
more than an objectionable draft, by which no country
has consented to be bound. Every day of the war makes
more apparent our debt to the House of Lords for having,
four years ago, prevented the British Government from
ratifying either the International Prize Court Convention
or this Declaration, which, while misleadingly professing
that its provisions &quot;correspond in substance with the
generally recognised principles of international law,&quot; contains,
interspersed with truisms familiar to all concerned
with such matters, a good many undesirable novelties.</p>

<p>This being so, it was surely unfortunate that our Government,
with a view apparently to saving time and trouble,
decided, in the early days of the war, to adopt the Declaration
<i>en bloc</i> as a statement of prize law &quot;during the present
hostilities,&quot; subject, however, to &quot;certain additions and
modifications&quot;; to which it, of course, retained the power
of making additions. This power has been so freely exercised,
and large portions of the Declaration, not thereby
affected, have proved to be so inapplicable to modern
conditions, as disclosed by the war, that the document, so
far from providing reliable guidance, is now a mere source
of hopeless confusion.</p>

<p>To put an end to this confusion, I venture to suggest
that, in concert with our Allies, the Declaration should be
<span class="newpage"><a name="page205" id="page205">[205]</a></span>finally consigned to oblivion. Either let its place be taken
by some clear and simple statement of unquestioned prize
law, for the use of commanders and officials (something
like a confidential document in the drafting of which I had
a hand some years ago, but, of course, brought up to date),
or let established principles take care of themselves, certain
doubtful points only being dealt with, from time to time,
by Orders in Council.</p>

<p>While heartily concurring in Lord Portsmouth's description
of the unratified &quot;Declaration&quot; as &quot;rubbish,&quot; I regret
that he seems to relegate to the same category even those
generally ratified &quot;Hague Conventions&quot; which, as far as
they go, mark a real advance upon previously accepted
rules. Still less acceptable is his advice to &quot;sweep away
juridical niceties&quot; in the conduct of hostilities. Did he
intend thus to describe the whole fabric of the rules by
which international law has endeavoured, with considerable
success, to restrain barbarity in warfare?</p>

<p>I must mention that this letter was written before
seeing this morning the letter of Mr. Gibson Bowles, my
worthy ally in attacks upon the Declaration.</p>

to criticise the Declaration of London, both in its original
inception and in its subsequent applications. Thanks to
the House of Lords, the Declaration, which erroneously
professed to &quot;correspond in substance with the generally
recognised principles of International Law,&quot; has remained
unratified, and therefore diplomatically of no effect.</p>

<p>Its admirers have, however, too long preserved it,
perhaps <i>sub spe rati</i>, in a state of suspended animation,
<span class="newpage"><a name="page206" id="page206">[206]</a></span>using it by way of, as they supposed, a convenient handbook
of maritime law for the purposes of the present war,
though subject to such variations as might from time to
time be found convenient by the Allies. The mistake
thus made soon became apparent. The elaborate classification
of contraband had to be at once thrown overboard,
and most of the remaining provisions of the Declaration
proved to be inapplicable to modern warfare.</p>

<p>In December last I accordingly wrote as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="letterquot"><p>&quot;To put an end to this confusion, I venture to suggest that, in
concert with our Allies, the Declaration should be finally consigned to
oblivion. Either let its place be taken by some clear and simple
statement of unquestioned prize law, for the use of commanders and
Officials, ... or established principles take care of themselves,
certain doubtful points only being dealt with from time to time by
Orders in Council.&quot;</p></div>

<p>I need hardly say that to anyone holding the views
thus expressed, yesterday's Order in Council must be most
satisfactory; getting rid, as it does for good and all, of the
unfortunate Declaration, leaving the application of established
principles to those acquainted with them and promulgating
authoritative guidance on specific novel questions.</p>

<p>I may perhaps add a word or two on the undesirability
of describing as &quot;Declarations&quot; documents which, being
equipped with provisions for ratification, although they
may profess to set out old law, differ in no respect from
other conventions. Also, as to the need for greater caution
on the part of our representatives than has been shown by
their acceptance of various craftily suggested anti-British
suggestions, such as were several embodied in the Declaration
in question, and notably that of the notorious
cl. 23 (<i>h</i>) of The Hague Convention iv., the interpretation
of which has exercised the ingenuity of the Foreign Office
and, more recently, of the Court of Appeal.</p>

<div class="postnotes"><p>On July 7, 1916, an Order in Council was made, revoking all Orders
by which the provisions of the Declaration had been adopted, or
modified, for the duration of the war; stating the intention of the
Allies to exercise their belligerent rights at sea in strict accordance with
the law of nations; but dealing specifically with certain doubtful
points. The Order was accompanied by a memorandum, drawn up
by the British and French Governments, explaining how their expectation
that in the Declaration they would find &quot;a suitable digest of
principles and compendium of working rules&quot; had not been realised.
See also Lord Robert Cecil in the House of Commons on August 23,
with reference to the Zamora case, [1916] 2 Ch. c. 77.</p>

<p class="lettertitle"><a name="GERMANY-WRONG-AGAIN" />GERMANY WRONG AGAIN</p>

<p>Sir,&mdash;The new German Note handed on Thursday last
to the representatives of the neutral Powers supports its
allegation that the four Allied Powers &quot;have trampled upon
right and torn up the treaties on which it was based&quot; by
the following statement:&mdash;</p>

<div class="letterquot"><p>&quot;Already in the first weeks of the war England had renounced
the Declaration of London, the contents of which her own delegates
had recognised as binding in international law.&quot;</p></div>

<p>It is surely notorious that the delegates of a Power, by
agreeing to the draft of a treaty, give to it no international
validity, which results only when the treaty has been ratified
by their Government. The Declaration of London has,
most fortunately, never been ratified by the Government
of Great Britain.</p>

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
